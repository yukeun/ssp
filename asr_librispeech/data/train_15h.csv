3214-167607-0000.flac,WHY AND HOW WERE THE BATTLES OF SHEVARDINO AND BORODINO GIVEN AND ACCEPTED WHY WAS THE BATTLE OF BORODINO FOUGHT THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST SENSE IN IT FOR EITHER THE FRENCH OR THE RUSSIANS ITS IMMEDIATE RESULT FOR THE RUSSIANS WAS AND WAS BOUND TO BE
3214-167607-0001.flac,THAT WE WERE BROUGHT NEARER TO THE DESTRUCTION OF MOSCOW WHICH WE FEARED MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD AND FOR THE FRENCH ITS IMMEDIATE RESULT WAS THAT THEY WERE BROUGHT NEARER TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR WHOLE ARMY WHICH THEY FEARED MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
3214-167607-0002.flac,WHAT THE RESULT MUST BE WAS QUITE OBVIOUS AND YET NAPOLEON OFFERED AND KUTUZOV ACCEPTED THAT BATTLE IF THE COMMANDERS HAD BEEN GUIDED BY REASON IT WOULD SEEM THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS TO NAPOLEON
3214-167607-0003.flac,THAT BY ADVANCING THIRTEEN HUNDRED MILES AND GIVING BATTLE WITH A PROBABILITY OF LOSING A QUARTER OF HIS ARMY HE WAS ADVANCING TO CERTAIN DESTRUCTION AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN EQUALLY CLEAR TO KUTUZOV THAT BY ACCEPTING BATTLE
3214-167607-0004.flac,AND GO ON EXCHANGING I SHALL CERTAINLY LOSE AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT EXCHANGE WHEN MY OPPONENT HAS SIXTEEN MEN AND I HAVE FOURTEEN I AM ONLY ONE EIGHTH WEAKER THAN HE BUT WHEN I HAVE EXCHANGED THIRTEEN MORE MEN
3214-167607-0005.flac,HE WILL BE THREE TIMES AS STRONG AS I AM BEFORE THE BATTLE OF BORODINO OUR STRENGTH IN PROPORTION TO THE FRENCH WAS ABOUT AS FIVE TO SIX BUT AFTER THAT BATTLE IT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN ONE TO TWO PREVIOUSLY
3214-167607-0006.flac,WE HAD A HUNDRED THOUSAND AGAINST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND AFTERWARDS LITTLE MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND AGAINST A HUNDRED THOUSAND YET THE SHREWD AND EXPERIENCED KUTUZOV ACCEPTED THE BATTLE WHILE NAPOLEON
3214-167607-0007.flac,AS HE HAD ENDED A PREVIOUS CAMPAIGN BY OCCUPYING VIENNA THERE IS MUCH EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY NAPOLEON'S HISTORIANS THEMSELVES TELL US THAT FROM SMOLENSK ONWARDS HE WISHED TO STOP
3214-167607-0008.flac,TO HIS REPEATED ANNOUNCEMENTS OF HIS WISH TO NEGOTIATE IN GIVING AND ACCEPTING BATTLE AT BORODINO KUTUZOV ACTED INVOLUNTARILY AND IRRATIONALLY BUT LATER ON TO FIT WHAT HAD OCCURRED
3214-167607-0009.flac,THE HISTORIANS PROVIDED CUNNINGLY DEVISED EVIDENCE
3214-167607-0010.flac,OF ALL THE BLIND TOOLS OF HISTORY WERE THE MOST ENSLAVED AND INVOLUNTARY THE ANCIENTS HAVE LEFT US MODEL HEROIC POEMS IN WHICH THE HEROES FURNISH THE WHOLE INTEREST OF THE STORY
3214-167607-0011.flac,AND WE ARE STILL UNABLE TO ACCUSTOM OURSELVES TO THE FACT THAT FOR OUR EPOCH HISTORIES OF THAT KIND ARE MEANINGLESS ON THE OTHER QUESTION HOW THE BATTLE OF BORODINO AND THE PRECEDING BATTLE OF SHEVARDINO WERE FOUGHT
3214-167607-0012.flac,THERE ALSO EXISTS A DEFINITE AND WELL KNOWN BUT QUITE FALSE CONCEPTION ALL THE HISTORIANS DESCRIBE THE AFFAIR AS FOLLOWS THE RUSSIAN ARMY THEY SAY IN ITS RETREAT FROM SMOLENSK SOUGHT OUT FOR ITSELF THE BEST POSITION FOR A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT
3214-167607-0013.flac,AT THE VERY PLACE WHERE THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT IN FRONT OF THIS POSITION THEY SAY A FORTIFIED OUTPOST WAS SET UP ON THE SHEVARDINO MOUND TO OBSERVE THE ENEMY ON THE TWENTY FOURTH WE ARE TOLD NAPOLEON ATTACKED THIS ADVANCED POST AND TOOK IT
3214-167607-0014.flac,AND ON THE TWENTY SIXTH ATTACKED THE WHOLE RUSSIAN ARMY WHICH WAS IN POSITION ON THE FIELD OF BORODINO SO THE HISTORIES SAY AND IT IS ALL QUITE WRONG AS ANYONE WHO CARES TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER CAN EASILY CONVINCE HIMSELF
3214-167607-0015.flac,THE RUSSIANS DID NOT SEEK OUT THE BEST POSITION BUT ON THE CONTRARY DURING THE RETREAT PASSED MANY POSITIONS BETTER THAN BORODINO THEY DID NOT STOP AT ANY ONE OF THESE POSITIONS BECAUSE KUTUZOV DID NOT WISH TO OCCUPY A POSITION
3214-167607-0016.flac,HE HAD NOT HIMSELF CHOSEN BECAUSE THE POPULAR DEMAND FOR A BATTLE HAD NOT YET EXPRESSED ITSELF STRONGLY ENOUGH AND BECAUSE MILORADOVICH HAD NOT YET ARRIVED WITH THE MILITIA AND FOR MANY OTHER REASONS
3214-167607-0017.flac,THE FACT IS THAT OTHER POSITIONS THEY HAD PASSED WERE STRONGER AND THAT THE POSITION AT BORODINO THE ONE WHERE THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT FAR FROM BEING STRONG WAS NO MORE A POSITION THAN ANY OTHER SPOT ONE MIGHT FIND IN THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE
3214-167607-0018.flac,BY STICKING A PIN INTO THE MAP AT HAZARD NOT ONLY DID THE RUSSIANS NOT FORTIFY THE POSITION ON THE FIELD OF BORODINO TO THE LEFT OF AND AT A RIGHT ANGLE TO THE HIGHROAD
3214-167607-0019.flac,THAT IS THE POSITION ON WHICH THE BATTLE TOOK PLACE BUT NEVER TILL THE TWENTY FIFTH OF AUGUST EIGHTEEN TWELVE DID THEY THINK THAT A BATTLE MIGHT BE FOUGHT THERE THIS WAS SHOWN FIRST BY THE FACT THAT THERE WERE NO ENTRENCHMENTS THERE BY THE TWENTY FIFTH
3214-167607-0020.flac,AND THAT THOSE BEGUN ON THE TWENTY FIFTH AND TWENTY SIXTH WERE NOT COMPLETED AND SECONDLY BY THE POSITION OF THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT THAT REDOUBT WAS QUITE SENSELESS IN FRONT OF THE POSITION WHERE THE BATTLE WAS ACCEPTED
3214-167607-0021.flac,STRONGLY FORTIFIED THAN ANY OTHER POST AND WHY WERE ALL EFFORTS EXHAUSTED AND SIX THOUSAND MEN SACRIFICED TO DEFEND IT TILL LATE AT NIGHT ON THE TWENTY FOURTH A COSSACK PATROL WOULD HAVE SUFFICED TO OBSERVE THE ENEMY THIRDLY
3214-167607-0022.flac,THAT THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT WAS AN ADVANCED POST WHEREAS IN REALITY IT WAS SIMPLY A FORTIFIED POINT ON THE LEFT FLANK AND THAT THE BATTLE OF BORODINO WAS FOUGHT BY US ON AN ENTRENCHED POSITION PREVIOUSLY SELECTED WHERE
3214-167607-0023.flac,WHICH CROSSES THE HIGHROAD NOT AT A RIGHT ANGLE BUT AT AN ACUTE ANGLE SO THAT THE LEFT FLANK WAS AT SHEVARDINO
3214-167607-0024.flac,AND THE CENTER AT BORODINO AT THE CONFLUENCE OF THE RIVERS KOLOCHA AND VOYNA TO ANYONE WHO LOOKS AT THE FIELD OF BORODINO WITHOUT THINKING OF HOW THE BATTLE WAS ACTUALLY FOUGHT THIS POSITION
3214-167607-0025.flac,PROTECTED BY THE RIVER KOLOCHA PRESENTS ITSELF AS OBVIOUS FOR AN ARMY WHOSE OBJECT WAS TO PREVENT AN ENEMY FROM ADVANCING ALONG THE SMOLENSK ROAD TO MOSCOW NAPOLEON
3214-167607-0026.flac,ON THE TWENTY FOURTH DID NOT SEE AS THE HISTORY BOOKS SAY HE DID THE POSITION OF THE RUSSIANS FROM UTITSA TO BORODINO HE COULD NOT HAVE SEEN THAT POSITION BECAUSE IT DID NOT EXIST NOR DID HE SEE AN ADVANCED POST OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY
3214-167607-0027.flac,BUT WHILE PURSUING THE RUSSIAN REARGUARD HE CAME UPON THE LEFT FLANK OF THE RUSSIAN POSITION AT THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT AND UNEXPECTEDLY FOR THE RUSSIANS MOVED HIS ARMY ACROSS THE KOLOCHA
3214-167607-0028.flac,AND THE RUSSIANS NOT HAVING TIME TO BEGIN A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT WITHDREW THEIR LEFT WING FROM THE POSITION THEY HAD INTENDED TO OCCUPY AND TOOK UP A NEW POSITION WHICH HAD NOT BEEN FORESEEN AND WAS NOT FORTIFIED
3214-167607-0029.flac,BY CROSSING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE KOLOCHA TO THE LEFT OF THE HIGHROAD NAPOLEON SHIFTED THE WHOLE FORTHCOMING BATTLE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT LOOKING FROM THE RUSSIAN SIDE AND TRANSFERRED IT TO THE PLAIN BETWEEN UTITSA
3214-167607-0030.flac,SEMENOVSK AND BORODINO A PLAIN NO MORE ADVANTAGEOUS AS A POSITION THAN ANY OTHER PLAIN IN RUSSIA AND THERE THE WHOLE BATTLE OF THE TWENTY SIXTH OF AUGUST TOOK PLACE
3214-167607-0031.flac,HAD NAPOLEON NOT RIDDEN OUT ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTY FOURTH TO THE KOLOCHA AND HAD HE NOT THEN ORDERED AN IMMEDIATE ATTACK ON THE REDOUBT BUT HAD BEGUN THE ATTACK NEXT MORNING
3214-167607-0032.flac,WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE WHERE WE EXPECTED IT IN THAT CASE WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE DEFENDED THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT OUR LEFT FLANK STILL MORE OBSTINATELY WE SHOULD HAVE ATTACKED NAPOLEON IN THE CENTER OR ON THE RIGHT
3214-167607-0033.flac,AND THE ENGAGEMENT WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE ON THE TWENTY FIFTH IN THE POSITION WE INTENDED AND HAD FORTIFIED BUT AS THE ATTACK ON OUR LEFT FLANK TOOK PLACE IN THE EVENING AFTER THE RETREAT OF OUR REAR GUARD THAT IS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FIGHT
3214-167607-0034.flac,AT GRIDNEVA AND AS THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS DID NOT WISH OR WERE NOT IN TIME TO BEGIN A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT THEN ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTY FOURTH THE FIRST AND CHIEF ACTION OF THE BATTLE OF BORODINO
3214-167607-0035.flac,WAS ALREADY LOST ON THE TWENTY FOURTH AND OBVIOUSLY LED TO THE LOSS OF THE ONE FOUGHT ON THE TWENTY SIXTH AFTER THE LOSS OF THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT
3214-167607-0036.flac,NOT ONLY WAS THE RUSSIAN ARMY ON THE TWENTY SIXTH DEFENDED BY WEAK UNFINISHED ENTRENCHMENTS BUT THE DISADVANTAGE OF THAT POSITION WAS INCREASED BY THE FACT THAT THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS
3214-167607-0037.flac,NAMELY THE LOSS OF OUR POSITION ON THE LEFT FLANK AND THE SHIFTING OF THE WHOLE FIELD OF THE FORTHCOMING BATTLE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
3214-167607-0038.flac,AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD TO MOVE THEIR FORCES FROM RIGHT TO LEFT DURING THE BATTLE SO IT HAPPENED THAT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BATTLE THE RUSSIANS OPPOSED THE ENTIRE FRENCH ARMY LAUNCHED AGAINST OUR LEFT FLANK WITH BUT HALF AS MANY MEN
3214-167607-0039.flac,PONIATOWSKI'S ACTION AGAINST UTITSA AND UVAROV'S ON THE RIGHT FLANK AGAINST THE FRENCH WERE ACTIONS DISTINCT FROM THE MAIN COURSE OF THE BATTLE SO THE BATTLE OF BORODINO DID NOT TAKE PLACE AT ALL AS
3214-167607-0040.flac,IN AN EFFORT TO CONCEAL OUR COMMANDERS MISTAKES EVEN AT THE COST OF DIMINISHING THE GLORY DUE TO THE RUSSIAN ARMY AND PEOPLE IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED
3214-167602-0000.flac,HE SAW THAT HIS HERO AND COMMANDER WAS FOLLOWING QUITE A DIFFERENT TRAIN OF THOUGHT ROSTOV GLANCED ANGRILY AT ILYIN AND WITHOUT REPLYING STRODE OFF WITH RAPID STEPS TO THE VILLAGE I'LL SHOW THEM I'LL GIVE IT TO THEM THE BRIGANDS SAID HE TO HIMSELF
3214-167602-0001.flac,WHAT DECISION HAVE YOU BEEN PLEASED TO COME TO SAID HE ROSTOV STOPPED
3214-167602-0002.flac,DECISION WHAT DECISION
3214-167602-0003.flac,AND YOU CAN'T MANAGE THEM YOU'RE A TRAITOR YOURSELF I KNOW YOU I'LL FLAY YOU ALL ALIVE AND AS IF AFRAID OF WASTING HIS STORE OF ANGER HE LEFT ALPATYCH AND WENT RAPIDLY FORWARD ALPATYCH MASTERING HIS OFFENDED FEELINGS KEPT PACE WITH ROSTOV AT A GLIDING GAIT
3214-167602-0004.flac,AND CONTINUED TO IMPART HIS VIEWS HE SAID THE PEASANTS WERE OBDURATE AND THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT IT WOULD BE IMPRUDENT TO OVERRESIST THEM WITHOUT AN ARMED FORCE AND WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER FIRST TO SEND FOR THE MILITARY I'LL GIVE THEM ARMED FORCE
3214-167602-0005.flac,WITHOUT CONSIDERING WHAT HE WOULD DO HE MOVED UNCONCIOUSLY WITH QUICK RESOLUTE STEPS TOWARD THE CROWD
3214-167602-0006.flac,THE PEASANTS IN THE CROWD WERE SIMILARLY IMPRESSED WHEN THEY SAW ROSTOV'S RAPID FIRM STEPS AND RESOLUTE FROWNING FACE AFTER THE HUSSARS HAD COME TO THE VILLAGE AND ROSTOV HAD GONE TO SEE THE PRINCESS A CERTAIN CONFUSION AND DISSENSION HAD ARISEN AMONG THE CROWD
3214-167602-0007.flac,SOME OF THE PEASANTS SAID THAT THESE NEW ARRIVALS WERE RUSSIANS AND MIGHT TAKE IT AMISS THAT THE MISTRESS WAS BEING DETAINED DRON WAS OF THIS OPINION BUT AS SOON AS HE EXPRESSED IT KARP AND OTHERS ATTACKED THEIR EX ELDER HOW MANY YEARS HAVE YOU BEEN FATTENING ON THE COMMUNE
3214-167602-0008.flac,WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO YOU WHETHER OUR HOMES ARE RUINED OR NOT WE'VE BEEN TOLD TO KEEP ORDER AND THAT NO ONE IS TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES OR TAKE AWAY A SINGLE GRAIN AND THAT'S ALL ABOUT IT CRIED ANOTHER IT WAS YOUR SON'S TURN TO BE CONSCRIPTED BUT NO FEAR
3214-167602-0009.flac,YOU BEGRUDGED YOUR LUMP OF A SON A LITTLE OLD MAN SUDDENLY BEGAN ATTACKING DRON
3214-167602-0010.flac,KARP THRUSTING HIS FINGERS INTO HIS BELT AND SMILING A LITTLE WALKED TO THE FRONT DRON ON THE CONTRARY RETIRED TO THE REAR AND THE CROWD DREW CLOSER TOGETHER
3214-167602-0011.flac,SHOUTED ROSTOV COMING UP TO THE CROWD WITH QUICK STEPS THE ELDER
3214-167602-0012.flac,BUT BEFORE THE WORDS WERE WELL OUT OF HIS MOUTH HIS CAP FLEW OFF AND A FIERCE BLOW JERKED HIS HEAD TO ONE SIDE CAPS OFF TRAITORS SHOUTED ROSTOV IN A WRATHFUL VOICE WHERE'S THE ELDER HE CRIED FURIOUSLY THE ELDER HE WANTS THE ELDER

3214-167602-0017.flac,BY NAME TO COME AND BIND KARP THE MEN OBEDIENTLY CAME OUT OF THE CROWD AND BEGAN TAKING OFF THEIR BELTS WHERE'S THE ELDER DEMANDED ROSTOV IN A LOUD VOICE WITH A PALE AND FROWNING FACE DRON STEPPED OUT OF THE CROWD ARE YOU THE ELDER BIND HIM LAVRUSHKA
3214-167602-0018.flac,SHOUTED ROSTOV AS IF THAT ORDER TOO COULD NOT POSSIBLY MEET WITH ANY OPPOSITION AND IN FACT TWO MORE PEASANTS BEGAN BINDING DRON WHO TOOK OFF HIS OWN BELT AND HANDED IT TO THEM AS IF TO AID THEM AND YOU ALL LISTEN TO ME SAID ROSTOV TO THE PEASANTS
3214-167602-0019.flac,BE OFF TO YOUR HOUSES AT ONCE AND DON'T LET ONE OF YOUR VOICES BE HEARD WHY WE'VE NOT DONE ANY HARM WE DID IT JUST OUT OF FOOLISHNESS IT'S ALL NONSENSE I SAID THEN THAT IT WAS NOT IN ORDER VOICES WERE HEARD BICKERING WITH ONE ANOTHER

3214-167602-0021.flac,TWO HOURS LATER THE CARTS WERE STANDING IN THE COURTYARD OF THE BOGUCHAROVO HOUSE THE PEASANTS WERE BRISKLY CARRYING OUT THE PROPRIETOR'S GOODS AND PACKING THEM ON THE CARTS AND DRON LIBERATED AT PRINCESS MARY'S WISH FROM THE CUPBOARD WHERE HE HAD BEEN CONFINED
3214-167602-0022.flac,WAS STANDING IN THE YARD DIRECTING THE MEN DON'T PUT IT IN SO CARELESSLY SAID ONE OF THE PEASANTS

3214-167602-0026.flac,UNWILLING TO OBTRUDE HIMSELF ON THE PRINCESS ROSTOV DID NOT GO BACK TO THE HOUSE BUT REMAINED IN THE VILLAGE AWAITING HER DEPARTURE WHEN HER CARRIAGE DROVE OUT OF THE HOUSE HE MOUNTED AND ACCOMPANIED HER EIGHT MILES FROM BOGUCHAROVO TO WHERE THE ROAD WAS OCCUPIED BY OUR TROOPS
3214-167602-0027.flac,AT THE INN AT YANKOVO HE RESPECTFULLY TOOK LEAVE OF HER FOR THE FIRST TIME PERMITTING HIMSELF TO KISS HER HAND HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO HE BLUSHINGLY REPLIED TO PRINCESS MARY'S EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE FOR HER DELIVERANCE AS SHE TERMED WHAT HAD OCCURRED
3214-167602-0028.flac,SAID HE WITH A SENSE OF SHAME AND WISHING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT
3214-167602-0029.flac,GOOD BYE PRINCESS I WISH YOU HAPPINESS AND CONSOLATION AND HOPE TO MEET YOU AGAIN IN HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES IF YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE ME BLUSH PLEASE DON'T THANK ME BUT THE PRINCESS IF SHE DID NOT AGAIN THANK HIM IN WORDS
3214-167602-0030.flac,THANKED HIM WITH THE WHOLE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE RADIANT WITH GRATITUDE AND TENDERNESS SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO THANK HIM FOR ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMED TO HER CERTAIN THAT HAD HE NOT BEEN THERE SHE WOULD HAVE PERISHED AT THE HANDS OF THE MUTINEERS AND OF THE FRENCH
3214-167602-0031.flac,HONEST EYES WITH THE TEARS RISING IN THEM WHEN SHE HERSELF HAD BEGUN TO CRY AS SHE SPOKE OF HER LOSS DID NOT LEAVE HER MEMORY WHEN SHE HAD TAKEN LEAVE OF HIM AND REMAINED ALONE SHE SUDDENLY FELT HER EYES FILLING WITH TEARS
3214-167602-0032.flac,MORE THAN ONCE NOTICED THAT HER MISTRESS LEANED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SMILED AT SOMETHING WITH AN EXPRESSION OF MINGLED JOY AND SORROW WELL SUPPOSING I DO LOVE HIM THOUGHT PRINCESS MARY ASHAMED AS SHE WAS OF ACKNOWLEDGING TO HERSELF THAT SHE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH A MAN WHO
3214-167602-0033.flac,WOULD PERHAPS NEVER LOVE HER SHE COMFORTED HERSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW IT AND THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE TO BLAME IF WITHOUT EVER SPEAKING OF IT TO ANYONE SHE CONTINUED TO THE END OF HER LIFE TO LOVE THE MAN WITH WHOM SHE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME IN HER LIFE
3214-167602-0034.flac,SOMETIMES WHEN SHE RECALLED HIS LOOKS HIS SYMPATHY AND HIS WORDS HAPPINESS DID NOT APPEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO HER IT WAS AT THOSE MOMENTS THAT DUNYASHA NOTICED HER SMILING AS SHE LOOKED OUT OF THE CARRIAGE WINDOW WAS IT NOT FATE THAT BROUGHT HIM TO BOGUCHAROVO AND AT THAT VERY MOMENT THOUGHT PRINCESS MARY
3214-167602-0035.flac,AND THAT CAUSED HIS SISTER TO REFUSE MY BROTHER AND IN ALL THIS PRINCESS MARY SAW THE HAND OF PROVIDENCE THE IMPRESSION THE PRINCESS MADE ON ROSTOV WAS A VERY AGREEABLE ONE TO REMEMBER HER GAVE HIM PLEASURE
3214-167602-0036.flac,RALLIED HIM ON HAVING GONE TO LOOK FOR HAY AND HAVING PICKED UP ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST HEIRESSES IN RUSSIA HE GREW ANGRY IT MADE HIM ANGRY JUST BECAUSE THE IDEA OF MARRYING THE GENTLE PRINCESS MARY WHO WAS ATTRACTIVE TO HIM

5703-47198-0006.flac,SHE MIGHT EVEN HAVE GONE FURTHER AND SAID THAT SHE HAD NEVER HAD A LETTER FROM ENGLAND EXCEPT WHILE SIR ARTHUR WAS THERE ON LEAVE IT WAS A LARGE ENVELOPE ADDRESSED IN A CLERK'S HANDWRITING AND SHE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION AS SHE TORE IT OPEN

5703-47198-0029.flac,THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RUN OVER WITH HER LADY BYRNE DECLARED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO DO SO SHE HAD ENGAGEMENTS SHE SAID FOR EVERY DAY OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK WHICH IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO BREAK
5703-47198-0030.flac,HAD SIR ARTHUR FORGOTTEN THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE HAVING LARGE DINNER PARTIES ON TUESDAY AND FRIDAY WHAT SHE WOULD DO WITHOUT JULIET TO HELP HER IN PREPARING FOR THEM SHE DID NOT KNOW
5703-47198-0031.flac,BUT AT LEAST IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT SOME ONE MUST BE THERE TO RECEIVE HIS GUESTS NO JULIET WOULD HAVE TO GO ALONE SHE WAS REALLY OLD ENOUGH TO BE TRUSTED BY HERSELF FOR THREE DAYS AND THERE WAS NO NEED THAT SHE COULD SEE
5703-47198-0032.flac,SHE CAN GO ON MONDAY SEE THE LAWYERS ON TUESDAY AND COME BACK ON WEDNESDAY SAID LADY BYRNE THE HELPLESSNESS OF YOUNG GIRLS IS THE ONE THING I DISAPPROVE OF IN YOUR EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF EDUCATION
5703-47198-0033.flac,SUPPOSING SHE IS DETAINED IN LONDON HE SAID WHAT SHOULD DETAIN HER DEMANDED HIS WIFE UNLESS IT IS THE DISCOVERY OF HER PARENTS AND IF SHE FINDS THEM I PRESUME THEY WILL BE CAPABLE OF LOOKING AFTER HER IN ANY CASE
5703-47198-0034.flac,SHE CAN WRITE OR CABLE TO US WHEN SHE HAS SEEN THE SOLICITORS AND IT IS NO USE PROVIDING FOR CONTINGENCIES THAT WILL PROBABLY NEVER ARISE
5703-47198-0035.flac,A LETTER WAS WRITTEN AND DISPATCHED TO MESSRS FINDLAY AND INCE SAYING THAT MISS BYRNE WOULD HAVE PLEASURE IN CALLING UPON THEM AT TWELVE O'CLOCK ON THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY AND JULIET BUSIED HERSELF IN PREPARATIONS FOR HER JOURNEY
5703-47198-0036.flac,ON MONDAY MORNING SHE LEFT OSTEND IN THE COMPANY OF HER MAID IT WAS A GLORIOUS AUGUST DAY ON SHORE THE HEAT WAS INTENSE AND IT WAS A RELIEF TO GET OUT OF THE STIFLING CARRIAGES OF THE CROWDED BOAT TRAIN
5703-47198-0037.flac,AND TO BREATHE THE GENTLE AIR FROM THE SEA THAT MET THEM AS THEY CROSSED THE GANGWAY ON TO THE STEAMER JULIET ENJOYED EVERY MOMENT OF THE JOURNEY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY WHEN THE CROSSING WAS OVER IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN SO EAGER TO SET FOOT UPON HER NATIVE SOIL
5703-47198-0038.flac,SHE LEANT UPON THE RAIL IN THE BOWS OF THE SHIP WATCHING THE WHITE CLIFFS GROW TALLER AND MORE DISTINCT AND FELT THAT NOW INDEED SHE UNDERSTOOD THE EMOTIONS
5703-47198-0039.flac,WITH WHICH THE HEART OF THE EXILE IS SAID TO SWELL AT THE SIGHT OF HIS OWN LAND SHE WONDERED IF THE SIGHT OF THEIR COUNTRY MOVED OTHER PASSENGERS ON THE BOAT AS SHE HERSELF WAS MOVED AND MADE TIMID ADVANCES TO A LADY WHO WAS STANDING NEAR HER
5703-47198-0040.flac,HAVE YOU BEEN AWAY FROM ENGLAND A LONG TIME SHE ASKED HER I HAVE BEEN ABROAD DURING A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD REPLIED THE PERSON SHE ADDRESSED A STERN LOOKING SCOTCHWOMAN WHO DID NOT APPEAR ANXIOUS TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION
5703-47198-0041.flac,FROM HER SEVERE DEMEANOUR JULIET IMAGINED SHE MIGHT BE A GOVERNESS GOING FOR A HOLIDAY YOU MUST BE GLAD TO BE GOING HOME SHE VENTURED IT'S A FAR CRY NORTH TO MY HOME SAID THE SCOTCHWOMAN THAWING SLIGHTLY
5703-47198-0042.flac,THERE MAY EVEN BE A SCOTCHMAN AMONG THE PORTERS YOU KNOW BY SOME CHANCE NO FEAR SAID HER NEIGHBOUR GLOOMILY THEY'LL BE LOCAL MEN I HAVE NAE DOUBT
5703-47198-0043.flac,WHICH IS ONE OF THE BONNIEST THINGS YOU SEE ON THE CONTINENT TO MY WAY OF THINKING JULIET COULD GET NO ENTHUSIASM OUT OF HER AND LOOK WHICH WAY SHE MIGHT SHE COULD NOT SEE ANY REFLECTION ON THE FACES OF THOSE AROUND HER OF THE EMOTIONS WHICH STIRRED IN HER OWN BREAST
5703-47198-0044.flac,IT HAD BEEN A ROUGH CROSSING IN SPITE OF THE CLOUDLESS SKY AND BROILING SUNSHINE AND MOST OF THE PASSENGERS HAD BEEN LAID LOW BY THE ROLLING OF THE VESSEL THEY DISPLAYED ANXIETY ENOUGH TO REACH LAND
5703-47198-0045.flac,NO DOUBT SHE THOUGHT WHEN THE SHIP STOPPED AND THEY FELT BETTER THEY WOULD BE MORE DISPOSED TO A SENTIMENTALITY LIKE HERS SHE FOUND HER MAID WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE MOST SEA SICK OF THOSE ABOARD AND ASSISTED HER ASHORE
5703-47198-0046.flac,PUT HER INTO A CARRIAGE AND MINISTERED TO HER WANTS WITH THE HELP OF A TEA BASKET CONTAINING THE DELICIOUS NOVELTY OF ENGLISH BREAD AND BUTTER IN HALF AN HOUR'S TIME THEY WERE STEAMING HURRIEDLY TOWARDS LONDON SHE WAS TO LODGE AT A SMALL HOTEL IN JERMYN STREET
5703-47198-0047.flac,SHE WAS YOUNG STRONG AND HEALTHY AND THERE WAS NO REASON THAT TRIFLING DISCOMFORTS OF THIS KIND SHOULD AFFECT HER ENJOYMENT TO THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE BED INDEED SHE SHUT HER EYES IN MORE SENSES THAN ONE
5703-47198-0048.flac,FOR SHE WAS ASLEEP THREE MINUTES AFTER HER HEAD TOUCHED THE PILLOW NOR DID SHE WAKE TILL HER MAID ROUSED HER THE NEXT MORNING
5703-47198-0049.flac,OVER THE ROOFS OF THE HOUSES OPPOSITE SHE COULD SEE A BLUE STREAK OF SKY ALREADY THE AIR HAD LOST THE TOUCH OF FRESHNESS WHICH COMES EVEN TO LONDON IN AUGUST DURING THE FIRST HOURS OF THE MORNING
5703-47198-0050.flac,AND THE HEAT IN THE LOW CEILINGED ROOM ON THE THIRD FLOOR WHICH JULIET OCCUPIED FOR THE SAKE OF ECONOMY WAS OPPRESSIVE IN SPITE OF THE SMALL SASH WINDOWS BEING OPENED TO THEIR UTMOST CAPACITY
5703-47198-0051.flac,BUT JULIET ONLY LAUGHED TO HERSELF WITH PLEASURE AT THE BRILLIANCY OF THE DAY SHE FELT THAT THE WEATHER WAS PLAYING UP TO THE OCCASION AS BECAME THIS IMPORTANT MORNING OF HER LIFE FOR THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT SHE DID NOT DOUBT
5703-47198-0052.flac,SHE WAS GOING TO HEAR TREMENDOUS NEWS THAT DAY MAKE WONDERFUL DISCOVERIES ABOUT HER BIRTH HEAR UNDREAMT OF THINGS
5703-47198-0053.flac,AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE ASTONISHED HER TO FIND HERSELF CLAIMED AS DAUGHTER BY ANY OF THE REIGNING FAMILIES OF EUROPE SHE WAS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING OR SO SHE SAID TO HERSELF HOWEVER ASTOUNDING AND THAT BEING SO SHE WAS EXCITED IN PROPORTION
5703-47198-0054.flac,ANYONE COULD HAVE TOLD HER THAT BY THIS ATTITUDE OF MIND TOWARDS THE FUTURE SHE WAS LAYING UP FOR HERSELF DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE LEAST IF NOT THE BITTEREST DISILLUSIONS BUT THERE WAS NO ONE TO THROW COLD WATER ON HER HOPES
5703-47198-0055.flac,AND SHE FILLED THE AIR WITH CASTLES OF EVERY STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE THAT HER FANCY SUGGESTED WITHOUT ANY HINDRANCE FROM DOUBT OR MISGIVING SHE DRESSED QUICKLY IN THE GAYEST HUMOUR BUT WITH EVEN MORE CARE THAN SHE USUALLY BESTOWED UPON HER APPEARANCE
5703-47198-0056.flac,SCANDALIZED AT THE IDEA OF SUCH A PRECIOUS GARMENT BEING PUT ON BEFORE BREAKFAST THAT VERY ONE JULIET ASSURED HER UNDAUNTED AND WAS ARRAYED IN IT IN SPITE OF OBVIOUS DISAPPROVAL AFTER BREAKFAST THEY WENT OUT
5703-47198-0057.flac,AND INQUIRING THEIR WAY TO BOND STREET FLATTENED THEIR NOSES AGAINST THE SHOP WINDOWS TO THEIR MUTUAL SATISFACTION THEY HAD IT ALMOST TO THEMSELVES FOR THERE WERE NOT MANY PEOPLE LEFT IN THAT PART OF LONDON
5703-47198-0058.flac,BUT MORE THAN ONE HEAD WAS TURNED TO GAZE AT THE PRETTY GIRL IN THE GARDEN PARTY DRESS WHO STOOD TRANSFIXED BEFORE SHOP AFTER SHOP THIS AMUSEMENT LASTED TILL HALF PAST ELEVEN WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THE HOTEL FOR JULIET TO GIVE THE FINAL PATS TO HER HAIR
5703-47198-0059.flac,BEFORE SHE STARTED TO KEEP HER APPOINTMENT WITH THE SOLICITORS
5703-47212-0000.flac,WITH HER WHITE PAINT AND HER SCARLET SMOKESTACK THE INVERASHIEL ONE OF THE TWO SMALL STEAMERS THAT DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS PLIED UP AND DOWN THE LOCH AND INCIDENTALLY CARRIED ON COMMUNICATION BETWEEN INVERASHIEL AND CRIANAN
5703-47212-0001.flac,WAS A PICTURESQUE ADDITION TO THE LANDSCAPE AS SHE APPROACHED THE WOODEN LANDING STAGE THAT STOOD HALF A MILE BELOW THE PROMONTORY ON WHICH THE CASTLE WAS BUILT IT WAS THE MORNING OF FRIDAY THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL
5703-47212-0002.flac,IN SPITE OF THE BRILLIANT SUNSET OF THE PREVIOUS EVENING THE LOCH LAY DARK AND STILL ITS SURFACE WORE AN OILY TREACHEROUS LOOK EVERY DETAIL OF THE INVERASHIEL'S TUB LIKE SHAPE WAS REFLECTED AND BEAUTIFULLY DISTORTED IN THE WATER
5703-47212-0003.flac,AS THE FEW PASSENGERS WHO WERE WAITING FOR HER CROSSED THE SHORT GANGWAY A SHOWER BURST OVER THE LOCH AND IN A FEW MINUTES HAD DRIVEN EVERY ONE INTO THE LITTLE CABIN EXCEPT THE TWO OR THREE MEN WHO CONSTITUTED THE OFFICERS AND CREW OF THE STEAMER
5703-47212-0004.flac,ONE OF THESE WAS IN THE ACT OF SLACKENING THE ROPE BY WHICH THE BOAT HAD BEEN WARPED ALONGSIDE WHEN A RUNNING GESTICULATING FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DISTANCE SHOUTING TO THEM TO WAIT FOR HIM WAITED FOR ACCORDINGLY HE WAS AND IN A FEW MINUTES GIMBLET
5703-47212-0005.flac,RATHER OUT OF BREATH AFTER HIS RUN HURRIED ON BOARD AND WITH A WORD OF APOLOGY AND THANKS TO THE OBLIGING SKIPPER TURNED LIKE THE OTHER PASSENGERS TOWARDS THE SHELTER OF THE CABIN WITH HIS HAND ON THE KNOB OF THE DOOR HE HESITATED
5703-47212-0006.flac,THROUGH THE GLASS TOP HE HAD JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF A FIGURE THAT SEEMED FAMILIAR HE HAD SEEN THAT TWEED BEFORE THE SHORT GIRL WITH HER BACK TO HIM WAS WEARING THE DRESS IN WHICH HE HAD SEEN HER ON THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT
5703-47212-0007.flac,SEARCHING AMONG LORD ASHIEL'S PAPERS IN THE LIBRARY AT THE CASTLE IT WAS JULIA ROMANINOV BEYOND A DOUBT AND GIMBLET DREW BACK QUICKLY AND TOOK UP HIS POSITION BEHIND THE FUNNELS ON THE AFTER DECK
5703-47212-0008.flac,IN SPITE OF THE RAIN HE REMAINED THERE UNTIL THE BOAT REACHED CRIANAN LEANING AGAINST THE RAIL WITH HIS COLLAR TURNED UP AND HIS SOFT FELT HAT PULLED DOWN OVER HIS EARS SO THAT LITTLE OF HIM WAS VISIBLE EXCEPT THE TIP OF HIS NOSE
5703-47212-0009.flac,HIS MIND ALWAYS ACTIVE WAS BUSIER THAN USUAL AS HE WATCHED THE RIPPLES ROLL AWAY IN ENDLESS SUCCESSION FROM THE SIDES OF THE INVERASHIEL WHICH LOOKED SO STRANGELY LESS WHITE ON CLOSER INSPECTION
5703-47212-0010.flac,OR FOLLOWED THE SMOOTH SOARING MOVEMENTS OF THE GULLS THAT SWOOPED AND CIRCLED AROUND HER
5703-47212-0011.flac,AS THEY DREW NEAR TO CRIANAN HE CONCEALED HIMSELF STILL MORE CAREFULLY BEHIND A PILE OF CRATES AND NOT TILL MISS ROMANINOV HAD LEFT THE STEAMER DID HE EMERGE FROM HIS HIDING PLACE AND STEP WARILY OFF THE BOAT
5703-47212-0012.flac,THE YOUNG LADY WAS STILL IN SIGHT MAKING HER WAY UP THE STEEP PITCH OF THE MAIN STREET AND THE DETECTIVE FOLLOWED HER DISCREETLY LOITERING BEFORE SHOP WINDOWS AS IF FASCINATED BY THE DISPLAY OF SCOTTISH HOMESPUNS
5703-47212-0013.flac,OR SAMPLES OF ROYAL STEWART TARTAN AND TAKING AN EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST IN FISHING TACKLE AND TROUT FLIES BUT THOUGH THE GIRL LOOKED BACK MORE THAN ONCE THE LITTLE MAN IN THE ULSTER WHO WAS SO INTENT ON PICKING HIS WAY BETWEEN THE PUDDLES
5703-47212-0014.flac,DID NOT APPARENTLY PROVIDE HER WITH ANY FOOD FOR SUSPICION AND SHE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO SEE WHO WAS SO CAREFULLY SHELTERED BENEATH THE UMBRELLA HE CARRIED AT LAST THEY LEFT THE COBBLE STONES OF THE LITTLE TOWN AND EMERGED UPON THE HIGH ROAD
5703-47212-0015.flac,WHICH HERE RAN ACROSS THE OPEN MOORLAND IT WAS DIFFICULT NOW TO CONTINUE THE PURSUIT UNOBSERVED AND GIMBLET BECAME ABSORBED IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF AN ENORMOUS CAIRNGORM
5703-47212-0016.flac,WHICH WAS MASQUERADING AS AN ARTICLE OF PERSONAL ADORNMENT IN THE WINDOW OF THE LAST OUTLYING SHOP FROM THIS POSITION NOT WITHOUT ITS EMBARRASSMENTS SINCE A COUPLE OF BAREFOOTED CHILDREN CAME INSTANTLY TO THE DOOR WHERE THEY STOOD AND STARED AT HIM UNBLINKINGLY
5703-47212-0017.flac,HE SAW THE RUSSIAN ADVANCING AT A RAPID PACE ACROSS THE MOOR AND LOOK WHERE HE WOULD COULD PERCEIVE NO MEANS OF KEEPING UP WITH HER UNOBSERVED UPON THE BARE SIDE OF THE HILL JUST AS HE DECIDED THAT THE DISTANCE SEPARATING THEM HAD INCREASED TO AN EXTENT
5703-47212-0018.flac,WHICH WARRANTED HIS CONTINUING THE CHASE HE JOYFULLY SAW HER SLACKEN HER PACE AND AT THE SAME MOMENT A MAN WHO MUST HAVE BEEN SITTING BEHIND A BOULDER BESIDE THE ROAD ROSE TO HIS FEET OUT OF THE HEATHER AND CAME FORWARD TO MEET HER
5703-47212-0019.flac,FOR TEN LONG MINUTES THEY STOOD TALKING DRIVING POOR GIMBLET TO THE DESPERATE EXPEDIENT OF ENTERING THE SHOP AND DEMANDING A CLOSER ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE CAIRNGORM IT IS HUMILIATING TO RELATE THAT HE RECOILED BEFORE IT WHEN IT WAS PLACED IN HIS HAND
5703-47212-0020.flac,AND NEARLY FLED AGAIN INTO THE ROAD HOWEVER HE PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER AND HELD THE PROUD PROPRIETRESS A GAUNT GREY HAIRED WOMAN WITH KNITTING NEEDLES EVER CLICKING IN HER DEXTEROUS HANDS
5703-47212-0021.flac,IN CONVERSATION UPON THE THEME OF ITS UNIQUE BEAUTIES UNTIL THE SUBJECT WAS EXHAUSTED TO THE POINT OF COLLAPSE EVERY OTHER MINUTE HE MUST STROLL TO THE DOOR AND TAKE A LOOK UP AND DOWN THE ROAD A FRIEND HE EXPLAINED HAD PROMISED TO MEET HIM IN THAT PLACE
5703-47212-0022.flac,AND THOUGH THE SHOPWOMAN PLAINLY DOUBTED HIS VERACITY AND KEPT A SHARP EYE THAT HE DID NOT TAKE TO HIS HEELS WITH THE CAIRNGORM SHE DID NOT GO SO FAR AS TO SUGGEST HIS REMOVING HIMSELF FROM THE ZONE OF TEMPTATION
5703-47212-0023.flac,AT LAST WHEN FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME HE PUT HIS NOSE ROUND THE DOORPOST HE SAW THAT THE PAIR HAD SEPARATED AND WERE WALKING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THE GIRL CONTINUING ON HER WAY WHILE THE MAN RETURNED TO THE TOWN
5703-47212-0024.flac,HE WAS INDEED NOT A HUNDRED YARDS OFF GIMBLET PLUNGED ONCE MORE INTO THE SHOP AND FASTENED UPON SOME PENCILS WITH A ZEAL NOT VERY CONVINCING AFTER HIS DISAPPOINTING VACILLATION OVER THE BROOCH
5703-47212-0025.flac,WHICH SHE PRESSED UPON HIM AS PARTICULARLY SUITED TO HIS NEEDS AND CHARGED HIM FOURPENCE FOR BY THE TIME HE ISSUED FORTH INTO THE OPEN AIR HIS POCKETS FULL OF PACKAGES THE STRANGER HAD PASSED THE SHOP AND WAS TURNING THE CORNER OF THE NEXT HOUSE
5703-47212-0026.flac,TO HIM NOW GIMBLET DEVOTED HIS POWERS OF SHADOWING THERE WAS NO GREAT DIFFICULTY ABOUT IT THE MAN WALKED STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM LOOKING NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR TO THE LEFT
5703-47212-0027.flac,NARROW POINTED FOOTPRINTS THAT WERE DEEPLY IMPRESSED IN THE MUDDY PLACES HE HAD NO DOUBT THEY WERE THE SAME AS THOSE HE HAD NOTICED ON THE BEACH ON THE DAY OF HIS ARRIVAL AT INVERASHIEL
5703-47212-0028.flac,THE STRANGER TURNED INTO THE CRIANAN HOTEL WHICH STANDS ON THE LAKE FRONT FIFTY YARDS FROM THE LANDING PLACE OF THE LOCH STEAMERS GIMBLET PASSED THE DOOR WITHOUT PAUSING AND WENT DOWN TO THE LOCH WHERE HE MINGLED WITH THE BOATMEN AND LOAFERS WHO CONGREGATED BY THE WATERSIDE
5703-47212-0029.flac,HE KEPT HOWEVER A STRICT EYE ON THE DOOR OF THE HOTEL AND AFTER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SAW THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTENTIONS EMERGE WITH FISHING ROD AND BASKET
5703-47212-0030.flac,BUT NOW HE HAD A GOOD LOOK AS HE PASSED CLOSE BESIDE HIM HE WAS A TALL FAIR MAN EVIDENTLY A FOREIGNER BUT WITH NOTHING VERY STRIKING ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE A POINTED YELLOW BEARD HID THE LOWER PART OF HIS FACE
5703-47212-0031.flac,AND FOR THE REST HIS NOSE WAS SHORT HIS EYES BLUE AND CLOSE TOGETHER AND HIS FOREHEAD HIGH AND NARROW HE LOOKED CLOSELY AT GIMBLET AS HE WENT BY AND FOR A MOMENT THE EYES OF THE TWO MEN MET
5703-47212-0032.flac,BOTH EQUALLY INSCRUTABLE AND UNFLINCHING THEN THE STRANGER GLANCED ASIDE AND STRODE ON TO WHERE A SMALL BOAT LAY MOORED THE DETECTIVE TURNED HIS BACK WHILE THE FAIR MAN GOT IN AND PUSHED OFF INTO THE LOCH GENTLEMAN GOING FISHING
5703-47212-0033.flac,HE'S AXTRA FOND O THE FEESHIN WAS THE REPLY FOR A THAT HE'S A FOREIGN SHENTLEMAN WAITING TILL THE BOAT HAD BECOME A DISTANT SPECK ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS GIMBLET MADE HIS WAY INTO THE INN AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE LANDLORD
5703-47212-0034.flac,ON THE PRETEXT OF ENGAGING ROOMS FOR A FRIEND THE LANDLORD WAS SORRY BUT THE HOUSE WAS FULL
5703-47212-0035.flac,FOLKS TAK THEIR ROOMS A MONTH IN ADVANCE THEY COME HERE FOR THE FISHIN ON THE LOCH
5703-47212-0036.flac,INDEED I CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT GIMBLET ASSURED HIM I SUPPOSE YOU GET A LOT OF TOURISTS PASSING THROUGH THOUGH AMERICANS FOR INSTANCE

5703-47212-0041.flac,THE SECOND OF THE TWO LOCH STEAMERS WAS EDGING AWAY FROM THE PIER UNDER A CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE FROM HER FUNNEL THE RAIN HAD STOPPED THE PASSENGERS WERE SCATTERED ON THE DECK
5703-47212-0042.flac,AND IN THE BOWS OF THE VESSEL THE DETECTIVE CAUGHT SIGHT OF JULIA ROMANINOV'S TWEED CLAD FORM SHE WAS LEANING AGAINST THE RAIL AND GAZING AT A DISTANT PART OF THE LOCH WHERE A BLACK SPECK
5703-47212-0043.flac,IT WAS AS GIMBLET HAD EXPECTED AND THOUGH HE CHAFED AT THE DELAY HE REGRETTED LESS THAN HE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE THAT HE COULD NOT CATCH THE ROB ROY THE INVERASHIEL WOULD BE DUE ON HER HOMEWARD TRIP IN A COUPLE OF HOURS TIME
5703-47212-0044.flac,AND MEANWHILE HE HAD OTHER BUSINESS THAT MUST BE ATTENDED TO HE WENT FIRST TO THE POST OFFICE WHERE HE REGISTERED AND POSTED TO SCOTLAND YARD A PACKET HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM THEN AFTER ASKING HIS WAY OF THE SOCIABLE LANDLORD OF THE HOTEL
5703-47212-0045.flac,HE PROCEEDED TO THE POLICE STATION A SINGLE STORIED STONE BUILDING STANDING AT THE END OF A SIDE STREET HERE HE MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO THE INSPECTOR AND IMPARTED INFORMATION WHICH MADE THAT PERSONAGE OPEN HIS EYES CONSIDERABLY WIDER THAN WAS HIS CUSTOM
5703-47212-0046.flac,IF YOU WILL BRING ONE OF YOUR MEN AND COME WITH ME YOURSELF SAID GIMBLET AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE INTERVIEW
5703-47212-0047.flac,IN THE MEANTIME THERE WILL BE NO HARM DONE BY A WATCH BEING KEPT ON THE FOREIGN GENTLEMAN WHO IS AT THIS MOMENT TROLLING FOR SALMON ON THE LOCH THE INSPECTOR AGREED AND WHEN THE INVERASHIEL STARTED AN HOUR LATER ON HER VOYAGE DOWN THE LOCH
5703-47212-0048.flac,SHE CARRIED THE TWO POLICEMEN ON HER DECK AS WELL AS THE MOST NOTORIOUS DETECTIVE SHE WAS EVER LIKELY TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF CONVEYING IT WAS NEARLY THREE O'CLOCK WHEN THEY LANDED ON THE INVERASHIEL PIER
5703-47212-0049.flac,THE WEATHER WHICH FOR THE LAST FEW HOURS HAD LOOKED LIKE CLEARING HAD NOW TURNED DEFINITELY TO RAIN CLOUDS HAD DESCENDED ON THE HILLS AND THE TREES IN THE VALLEYS STOOPED AND DRIPPED IN THE SATURATED MIST LADEN AIR
5703-47212-0050.flac,GIMBLET CONDUCTED THE MEN TO THE COTTAGE WHERE LADY RUTH ANXIOUSLY AWAITED THEM IF YOU DON'T MIND THEIR STAYING HERE HE SUGGESTED TO HER WHILE I GO UP TO THE CASTLE AND CONSULT LORD ASHIEL ABOUT A MAGISTRATE IT WILL BE MOST CONVENIENT ON ACCOUNT OF THE DISTANCE
5703-47212-0051.flac,BY ALL MEANS SAID LADY RUTH I FEEL SAFER WITH THEM I EXPECT YOU WILL FIND MISS BYRNE UP THERE SHE HAS NOT COME IN TO LUNCH AND I THINK SHE PROBABLY MET MARK AND WENT TO LUNCH AT THE CASTLE SHE OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER THAN TO GO TO LUNCH ALONE WITH A YOUNG MAN
5703-47212-0052.flac,AND I AM JUST WONDERING IF SHE HAS CHANGED HER MIND AND ACCEPTED HIM AFTER ALL GIRLS ARE KITTLE CATTLE BUT I'VE GOT QUITE FOND OF THAT ONE AND I HOPE SHE'S NOT FORGOTTEN POOR DAVID SO SOON I REALLY AM FEELING ANXIOUS ABOUT HER
2817-142380-0000.flac,WITH TWO BEDS IN IT ONE LAID ON THE FLOOR IT IS TEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND THE DARK WALL OPPOSITE THE WINDOW SHUTS OUT THE MOONLIGHT THAT MIGHT HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THE LIGHT OF THE ONE DIP CANDLE BY WHICH BARTLE MASSEY IS PRETENDING TO READ
2817-142380-0001.flac,THE NEGLECTED BEARD OF A MAN JUST RISEN FROM A SICK BED HIS HEAVY BLACK HAIR HANGS OVER HIS FOREHEAD AND THERE IS NO ACTIVE IMPULSE IN HIM WHICH INCLINES HIM TO PUSH IT OFF THAT HE MAY BE MORE AWAKE TO WHAT IS AROUND HIM
2817-142380-0002.flac,HE HAS ONE ARM OVER THE BACK OF THE CHAIR AND HE SEEMS TO BE LOOKING DOWN AT HIS CLASPED HANDS HE IS ROUSED BY A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
2817-142380-0003.flac,SAID BARTLE MASSEY RISING HASTILY AND UNFASTENING THE DOOR IT WAS MISTER IRWINE ADAM ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR WITH INSTINCTIVE RESPECT AS MISTER IRWINE APPROACHED HIM AND TOOK HIS HAND I'M LATE ADAM
2817-142380-0004.flac,LET US ALL SIT DOWN ADAM TOOK HIS CHAIR AGAIN MECHANICALLY AND BARTLE FOR WHOM THERE WAS NO CHAIR REMAINING SAT ON THE BED IN THE BACKGROUND HAVE YOU SEEN HER SIR
2817-142380-0005.flac,YES ADAM I AND THE CHAPLAIN HAVE BOTH BEEN WITH HER THIS EVENING DID YOU ASK HER SIR DID YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME YES SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH SOME HESITATION
2817-142380-0006.flac,IT IS NOT ONLY YOU SOME FATAL INFLUENCE SEEMS TO HAVE SHUT UP HER HEART AGAINST HER FELLOW CREATURES SHE HAS SCARCELY SAID ANYTHING MORE THAN NO EITHER TO ME OR THE CHAPLAIN THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO BEFORE YOU WERE MENTIONED TO HER
2817-142380-0007.flac,WHEN I ASKED HER IF THERE WAS ANY ONE OF HER FAMILY WHOM SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TO WHOM SHE COULD OPEN HER MIND SHE SAID WITH A VIOLENT SHUDDER TELL THEM NOT TO COME NEAR ME I WON'T SEE ANY OF THEM
2817-142380-0008.flac,IF THEY NOW URGE YOU STRONGLY TO GO AND SEE HER TO MORROW MORNING EVEN WITHOUT HER CONSENT
2817-142380-0009.flac,THAT THE INTERVIEW MIGHT AFFECT HER FAVOURABLY BUT I GRIEVE TO SAY I HAVE SCARCELY ANY HOPE OF THAT SHE DIDN'T SEEM AGITATED WHEN I MENTIONED YOUR NAME SHE ONLY SAID NO IN THE SAME COLD OBSTINATE WAY AS USUAL
2817-142380-0010.flac,AND IF THE MEETING HAD NO GOOD EFFECT ON HER IT WOULD BE PURE USELESS SUFFERING TO YOU SEVERE SUFFERING I FEAR SHE IS VERY MUCH CHANGED ADAM STARTED UP FROM HIS CHAIR
2817-142380-0011.flac,AND SEIZED HIS HAT WHICH LAY ON THE TABLE BUT HE STOOD STILL THEN AND LOOKED AT MISTER IRWINE AS IF HE HAD A QUESTION TO ASK WHICH IT WAS YET DIFFICULT TO UTTER BARTLE MASSEY ROSE QUIETLY TURNED THE KEY IN THE DOOR
2817-142380-0012.flac,AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET IS HE COME BACK SAID ADAM AT LAST NO HE IS NOT SAID MISTER IRWINE QUIETLY LAY DOWN YOUR HAT ADAM UNLESS YOU LIKE TO WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A LITTLE FRESH AIR
2817-142380-0013.flac,I FEAR YOU HAVE NOT BEEN OUT AGAIN TO DAY YOU NEEDN'T DECEIVE ME SIR SAID ADAM LOOKING HARD AT MISTER IRWINE AND SPEAKING IN A TONE OF ANGRY SUSPICION YOU NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF ME I ONLY WANT JUSTICE
2817-142380-0014.flac,I WANT HIM TO FEEL WHAT SHE FEELS IT'S HIS WORK SHE WAS A CHILD AS IT UD HA GONE T ANYBODY'S HEART TO LOOK AT I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE'S DONE IT WAS HIM BROUGHT HER TO IT AND HE SHALL KNOW IT HE SHALL FEEL IT
2817-142380-0015.flac,TO SIN AND MISERY I'M NOT DECEIVING YOU ADAM SAID MISTER IRWINE ARTHUR DONNITHORNE IS NOT COME BACK WAS NOT COME BACK WHEN I LEFT I HAVE LEFT A LETTER FOR HIM HE WILL KNOW
2817-142380-0016.flac,HE WILL KNOW HE WILL SUFFER LONG AND BITTERLY HE HAS A HEART AND A CONSCIENCE I CAN'T BE ENTIRELY DECEIVED IN HIS CHARACTER I AM CONVINCED
2817-142380-0017.flac,HE MAY BE WEAK BUT HE IS NOT CALLOUS NOT COLDLY SELFISH I AM PERSUADED
2817-142380-0018.flac,ALL HIS LIFE WHY DO YOU CRAVE VENGEANCE IN THIS WAY NO AMOUNT OF TORTURE THAT YOU COULD INFLICT ON HIM COULD BENEFIT HER NO O GOD NO ADAM GROANED OUT SINKING ON HIS CHAIR AGAIN
2817-142380-0019.flac,BUT THEN THAT'S THE DEEPEST CURSE OF ALL THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE BLACKNESS OF IT IT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE MY POOR HETTY SHE CAN NEVER BE MY SWEET HETTY AGAIN THE PRETTIEST THING GOD HAD MADE
2817-142380-0020.flac,SMILING UP AT ME I THOUGHT SHE LOVED ME AND WAS GOOD ADAM'S VOICE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY SINKING INTO A HOARSE UNDERTONE AS IF HE WERE ONLY TALKING TO HIMSELF BUT NOW HE SAID ABRUPTLY LOOKING AT MISTER IRWINE
2817-142380-0021.flac,BUT SHE ISN'T AS GUILTY AS THEY SAY YOU DON'T THINK SHE IS SIR SHE CAN'T HA DONE IT THAT PERHAPS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY ADAM MISTER IRWINE ANSWERED GENTLY
2817-142380-0022.flac,IN THESE CASES WE SOMETIMES FORM OUR JUDGMENT ON WHAT SEEMS TO US STRONG EVIDENCE AND YET FOR WANT OF KNOWING SOME SMALL FACT OUR JUDGMENT IS WRONG BUT SUPPOSE THE WORST YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY
2817-142380-0023.flac,THAT THE GUILT OF HER CRIME LIES WITH HIM AND THAT HE OUGHT TO BEAR THE PUNISHMENT IT IS NOT FOR US MEN TO APPORTION THE SHARES OF MORAL GUILT AND RETRIBUTION WE FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID MISTAKES
2817-142380-0024.flac,EVEN IN DETERMINING WHO HAS COMMITTED A SINGLE CRIMINAL ACT AND THE PROBLEM
2817-142380-0025.flac,YOU HAVE A MIND THAT CAN UNDERSTAND THIS FULLY ADAM WHEN YOU ARE CALM DON'T SUPPOSE I CAN'T ENTER INTO THE ANGUISH THAT DRIVES YOU INTO THIS STATE OF REVENGEFUL HATRED BUT
2817-142380-0026.flac,FOR IT IS PASSION AND YOU DECEIVE YOURSELF IN CALLING IT JUSTICE IT MIGHT BE WITH YOU PRECISELY AS IT HAS BEEN WITH ARTHUR NAY WORSE YOUR PASSION MIGHT LEAD YOU YOURSELF INTO A HORRIBLE CRIME
2817-142380-0027.flac,NO NOT WORSE SAID ADAM BITTERLY I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WORSE I'D SOONER DO IT I'D SOONER DO A WICKEDNESS AS I COULD SUFFER FOR BY MYSELF THAN HA BROUGHT HER TO DO WICKEDNESS
2817-142380-0028.flac,AND THEN STAND BY AND SEE EM PUNISH HER WHILE THEY LET ME ALONE AND ALL FOR A BIT O PLEASURE AS IF HE'D HAD A MAN'S HEART IN HIM HE'D HA CUT HIS HAND OFF SOONER THAN HE'D HA TAKEN IT WHAT IF HE DIDN'T FORESEE WHAT'S HAPPENED
2817-142380-0029.flac,HE FORESAW ENOUGH HE'D NO RIGHT TO EXPECT ANYTHING BUT HARM AND SHAME TO HER
2817-142380-0030.flac,NOT HALF SO HATEFUL AS THAT LET A MAN DO WHAT HE WILL IF HE KNOWS HE'S TO BEAR THE PUNISHMENT HIMSELF
2817-142380-0031.flac,AND KNOWS ALL THE WHILE THE PUNISHMENT LL FALL ON SOMEBODY ELSE THERE AGAIN YOU PARTLY DECEIVE YOURSELF ADAM THERE IS NO SORT OF WRONG DEED OF WHICH A MAN CAN BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE YOU CAN'T ISOLATE YOURSELF
2817-142380-0032.flac,I FEEL THE TERRIBLE EXTENT OF SUFFERING THIS SIN OF ARTHUR'S HAS CAUSED TO OTHERS BUT SO DOES EVERY SIN CAUSE SUFFERING TO OTHERS BESIDES THOSE WHO COMMIT IT AN ACT OF VENGEANCE ON YOUR PART AGAINST ARTHUR WOULD SIMPLY BE ANOTHER EVIL
2817-142380-0033.flac,ADDED TO THOSE WE ARE SUFFERING UNDER YOU COULD NOT BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE YOU WOULD ENTAIL THE WORST SORROWS ON EVERY ONE WHO LOVES YOU YOU WOULD HAVE COMMITTED AN ACT OF BLIND FURY THAT WOULD LEAVE ALL THE PRESENT EVILS JUST AS THEY WERE
2817-142380-0034.flac,AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT SEE THAT TO FIX YOUR MIND ON ARTHUR'S PUNISHMENT IS REVENGE AND NOT JUSTICE YOU ARE IN DANGER OF BEING LED ON TO THE COMMISSION OF SOME GREAT WRONG REMEMBER WHAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS
2817-142380-0035.flac,AFTER YOU HAD GIVEN THAT BLOW TO ARTHUR IN THE GROVE ADAM WAS SILENT THE LAST WORDS HAD CALLED UP A VIVID IMAGE OF THE PAST AND MISTER IRWINE LEFT HIM TO HIS THOUGHTS
2817-142380-0036.flac,WHILE HE SPOKE TO BARTLE MASSEY ABOUT OLD MISTER DONNITHORNE'S FUNERAL AND OTHER MATTERS OF AN INDIFFERENT KIND BUT AT LENGTH ADAM TURNED ROUND AND SAID IN A MORE SUBDUED TONE
2817-142380-0037.flac,IS DINAH MORRIS COME TO EM SIR SETH SAID THEY'D SENT FOR HER NO MISTER POYSER TELLS ME SHE WAS NOT COME WHEN HE LEFT THEY'RE AFRAID THE LETTER HAS NOT REACHED HER
2817-142380-0038.flac,IT SEEMS THEY HAD NO EXACT ADDRESS ADAM SAT RUMINATING A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SAID
2817-142380-0039.flac,BUT PERHAPS THE POYSERS
2817-142380-0040.flac,SINCE THEY WON'T COME NIGH HER THEMSELVES BUT I THINK SHE WOULD FOR THE METHODISTS ARE GREAT FOLKS FOR GOING INTO THE PRISONS AND SETH SAID HE THOUGHT SHE WOULD SHE'D A VERY TENDER WAY WITH HER DINAH HAD
2817-142380-0041.flac,YOU NEVER SAW HER SIR DID YOU YES I DID I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HER SHE PLEASED ME A GOOD DEAL AND NOW YOU MENTION IT I WISH SHE WOULD COME FOR IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A GENTLE MILD WOMAN LIKE HER
2817-142380-0042.flac,IF I'D THOUGHT OF IT EARLIER I WOULD HAVE TAKEN SOME MEASURES FOR FINDING HER OUT SAID MISTER IRWINE BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW I FEAR WELL ADAM I MUST GO NOW TRY TO GET SOME REST TO NIGHT
2817-142371-0000.flac,THE NEXT SATURDAY EVENING THERE WAS MUCH EXCITED DISCUSSION AT THE DONNITHORNE ARMS CONCERNING AN INCIDENT WHICH HAD OCCURRED THAT VERY DAY NO LESS THAN A SECOND APPEARANCE OF THE SMART MAN IN TOP BOOTS
2817-142371-0001.flac,THE PERSONAL WITNESS TO THE STRANGER'S VISIT PRONOUNCED CONTEMPTUOUSLY TO BE NOTHING BETTER THAN A BAILIFF SUCH AS SATCHELL HAD BEEN BEFORE HIM NO ONE HAD THOUGHT OF DENYING MISTER CASSON'S TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT HE HAD SEEN THE STRANGER NEVERTHELESS
2817-142371-0002.flac,HE PROFFERED VARIOUS CORROBORATING CIRCUMSTANCES I SEE HIM MYSELF HE SAID I SEE HIM COMING ALONG BY THE CRAB TREE MEADOW ON A BALD FACED HOSS I'D JUST BEEN T HEV A PINT
2817-142371-0003.flac,AND JUST AS I COME UP BY THE BIG ASH TREE I SEE THE MAN TOP BOOTS COMING ALONG ON A BALD FACED HOSS I WISH I MAY NEVER STIR IF I DIDN'T AND I STOOD STILL TILL HE COME UP AND I SAYS GOOD MORNING SIR
2817-142371-0004.flac,I SAYS FOR I WANTED TO HEAR THE TURN OF HIS TONGUE AS I MIGHT KNOW WHETHER HE WAS A THIS COUNTRY MAN SO I SAYS GOOD MORNING SIR IT LL OLD HUP FOR THE BARLEY THIS MORNING I THINK THERE'LL BE A BIT GOT HIN IF WE'VE GOOD LUCK
2817-142371-0005.flac,YOU'RE ABOUT AS NEAR THE RIGHT LANGUAGE AS A PIG'S SQUEAKING IS LIKE A TUNE PLAYED ON A KEY BUGLE WELL I DON'T KNOW
2817-142371-0006.flac,I SHOULD THINK A MAN AS HAS LIVED AMONG THE GENTRY FROM A BY
2817-142371-0007.flac,AYE AYE MAN SAID BARTLE WITH A TONE OF SARCASTIC CONSOLATION YOU TALK THE RIGHT LANGUAGE FOR YOU WHEN MIKE HOLDSWORTH'S GOAT SAYS BA A A IT'S ALL RIGHT IT UD BE UNNATURAL FOR IT TO MAKE ANY OTHER NOISE
2817-142371-0008.flac,THE REST OF THE PARTY BEING LOAMSNIRE MEN
2817-142371-0009.flac,AND WISELY FELL BACK ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION WHICH FAR FROM BEING EXHAUSTED IN A SINGLE EVENING WAS RENEWED IN THE CHURCHYARD BEFORE SERVICE THE NEXT DAY WITH THE FRESH INTEREST CONFERRED ON ALL NEWS WHEN THERE IS A FRESH PERSON TO HEAR IT
2817-142371-0010.flac,AND THAT FRESH HEARER WAS MARTIN POYSER WHO AS HIS WIFE SAID
2817-142371-0011.flac,SHE ALWAYS CITED IT AFTERWARDS AS A CASE OF PREVISION WHICH REALLY HAD SOMETHING MORE IN IT THAN HER OWN REMARKABLE PENETRATION THAT THE MOMENT SHE SET EYES ON THE SQUIRE SHE SAID TO HERSELF I SHOULDNA WONDER IF HE'S COME ABOUT THAT MAN
2817-142371-0012.flac,AS IS A GOING TO TAKE THE CHASE FARM WANTING POYSER TO DO SOMETHING FOR HIM WITHOUT PAY BUT POYSER'S A FOOL IF HE DOES
2817-142371-0013.flac,FOR THE OLD SQUIRE'S VISITS TO HIS TENANTRY WERE RARE AND THOUGH MISSUS POYSER HAD DURING THE LAST TWELVEMONTH RECITED MANY IMAGINARY SPEECHES MEANING EVEN MORE THAN MET THE EAR
2817-142371-0014.flac,THE SPEECHES HAD ALWAYS REMAINED IMAGINARY GOOD DAY MISSUS POYSER SAID THE OLD SQUIRE PEERING AT HER WITH HIS SHORT SIGHTED EYES A MODE OF LOOKING AT HER WHICH AS MISSUS POYSER OBSERVED ALLAYS AGGRAVATED ME
2817-142371-0015.flac,IT WAS AS IF YOU WAS A INSECT AND HE WAS GOING TO DAB HIS FINGER NAIL ON YOU HOWEVER SHE SAID YOUR SERVANT SIR AND CURTSIED WITH AN AIR OF PERFECT DEFERENCE AS SHE ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM SHE WAS NOT THE WOMAN TO MISBEHAVE TOWARDS HER BETTERS
2817-142371-0016.flac,AND FLY IN THE FACE OF THE CATECHISM WITHOUT SEVERE PROVOCATION IS YOUR HUSBAND AT HOME MISSUS POYSER YES SIR HE'S ONLY THE RICK YARD I'LL SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE IF YOU'LL PLEASE TO GET DOWN AND STEP IN
2817-142371-0017.flac,THANK YOU I WILL DO SO I WANT TO CONSULT HIM ABOUT A LITTLE MATTER BUT YOU ARE QUITE AS MUCH CONCERNED IN IT IF NOT MORE I MUST HAVE YOUR OPINION TOO HETTY RUN AND TELL YOUR UNCLE TO COME IN
2817-142371-0018.flac,SAID MISSUS POYSER AS THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN BOWED LOW IN ANSWER TO HETTY'S CURTSY WHILE TOTTY CONSCIOUS OF A PINAFORE STAINED WITH GOOSEBERRY JAM STOOD HIDING HER FACE AGAINST THE CLOCK AND PEEPING ROUND FURTIVELY
2817-142371-0019.flac,WHAT A FINE OLD KITCHEN THIS IS SAID MISTER DONNITHORNE LOOKING ROUND ADMIRINGLY HE ALWAYS SPOKE IN THE SAME DELIBERATE WELL CHISELLED POLITE WAY WHETHER HIS WORDS WERE SUGARY OR VENOMOUS
2817-142371-0020.flac,AND YOU KEEP IT SO EXQUISITELY CLEAN MISSUS POYSER I LIKE THESE PREMISES DO YOU KNOW BEYOND ANY ON THE ESTATE WELL SIR SINCE YOU'RE FOND OF EM

2817-142371-0022.flac,NOT YET I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY
2817-142371-0023.flac,ON ALL HANDS ABOUT YOUR FINE CHEESE AND BUTTER SAID THE SQUIRE LOOKING POLITELY UNCONSCIOUS THAT THERE COULD BE ANY QUESTION ON WHICH HE AND MISSUS POYSER MIGHT HAPPEN TO DISAGREE I THINK I SEE THE DOOR OPEN THERE
2817-142371-0024.flac,YOU MUST NOT BE SURPRISED IF I CAST A COVETOUS EYE ON YOUR CREAM AND BUTTER I DON'T EXPECT THAT MISSUS SATCHELL'S CREAM AND BUTTER WILL BEAR COMPARISON WITH YOURS I CAN'T SAY SIR I'M SURE IT'S SELDOM I SEE OTHER FOLKS'S BUTTER
2817-142371-0025.flac,THOUGH THERE'S SOME ON IT AS ONE'S NO NEED TO SEE THE SMELL'S ENOUGH
2817-142371-0026.flac,BUT KEEPING NEAR THE DOOR I'M SURE I SHOULD LIKE MY BREAKFAST BETTER IF I KNEW THE BUTTER AND CREAM CAME FROM THIS DAIRY THANK YOU THAT REALLY IS A PLEASANT SIGHT UNFORTUNATELY MY SLIGHT TENDENCY TO RHEUMATISM MAKES ME AFRAID OF DAMP
2817-142371-0027.flac,I'LL SIT DOWN IN YOUR COMFORTABLE KITCHEN AH POYSER HOW DO YOU DO IN THE MIDST OF BUSINESS I SEE AS USUAL I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT YOUR WIFE'S BEAUTIFUL DAIRY
2817-142371-0028.flac,MISTER POYSER HAD JUST ENTERED IN SHIRT SLEEVES AND OPEN WAISTCOAT WITH A FACE A SHADE REDDER THAN USUAL FROM THE EXERTION OF PITCHING AS HE STOOD RED ROTUND AND RADIANT
2817-142371-0029.flac,SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN SEATING HIMSELF ON A SMALL CHAIR NEAR THE DOOR DO YOU KNOW MISSUS POYSER SIT DOWN PRAY BOTH OF YOU I'VE BEEN FAR FROM CONTENTED FOR SOME TIME WITH MISSUS SATCHELL'S DAIRY MANAGEMENT
2817-142371-0030.flac,I THINK SHE HAS NOT A GOOD METHOD AS YOU HAVE INDEED SIR I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT SAID MISSUS POYSER IN A HARD VOICE ROLLING AND UNROLLING HER KNITTING AND LOOKING ICILY OUT OF THE WINDOW AS SHE CONTINUED TO STAND OPPOSITE THE SQUIRE
2817-142371-0031.flac,POYSER MIGHT SIT DOWN IF HE LIKED SHE THOUGHT SHE WASN'T GOING TO SIT DOWN AS IF SHE'D GIVE IN TO ANY SUCH SMOOTH TONGUED PALAVER MISTER POYSER WHO LOOKED AND FELT THE REVERSE OF ICY DID SIT DOWN IN HIS THREE CORNERED CHAIR
2817-142371-0032.flac,AND NOW POYSER AS SATCHELL IS LAID UP I AM INTENDING TO LET THE CHASE FARM TO A RESPECTABLE TENANT I'M TIRED OF HAVING A FARM ON MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IS MADE THE BEST OF IN SUCH CASES AS YOU KNOW
2817-142371-0033.flac,SAID MISTER POYSER WITH A GOOD NATURED BLANKNESS OF IMAGINATION AS TO THE NATURE OF THE ARRANGEMENT IF I'M CALLED UPON TO SPEAK SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER AFTER GLANCING AT HER HUSBAND WITH PITY AT HIS SOFTNESS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ME

2817-142371-0037.flac,I THINK FOLKS HAVE TO WAIT LONG ENOUGH AFORE IT'S BROUGHT TO EM THE FACT IS POYSER SAID THE SQUIRE IGNORING MISSUS POYSER'S THEORY OF WORLDLY PROSPERITY
2817-142371-0038.flac,NOW THE PLAN I'M THINKING OF IS TO EFFECT A LITTLE EXCHANGE IF YOU WERE TO HAVE THE HOLLOW PASTURES YOU MIGHT INCREASE YOUR DAIRY WHICH MUST BE SO PROFITABLE UNDER YOUR WIFE'S MANAGEMENT AND I SHOULD REQUEST YOU MISSUS POYSER
2817-142371-0039.flac,THAN CORN LAND MISTER POYSER WAS LEANING FORWARD WITH HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND HIS MOUTH SCREWED UP
2817-142371-0040.flac,HE WAS MUCH TOO ACUTE A MAN NOT TO SEE THROUGH THE WHOLE BUSINESS AND TO FORESEE PERFECTLY WHAT WOULD BE HIS WIFE'S VIEW OF THE SUBJECT BUT HE DISLIKED GIVING UNPLEASANT ANSWERS UNLESS IT WAS ON A POINT OF FARMING PRACTICE
2817-142371-0041.flac,HE WOULD RATHER GIVE UP THAN HAVE A QUARREL ANY DAY AND AFTER ALL IT MATTERED MORE TO HIS WIFE THAN TO HIM SO AFTER A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE HE LOOKED UP AT HER AND SAID MILDLY WHAT DOST SAY
2817-142371-0042.flac,MISSUS POYSER HAD HAD HER EYES FIXED ON HER HUSBAND WITH COLD SEVERITY DURING HIS SILENCE BUT NOW SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD WITH A TOSS LOOKED ICILY AT THE OPPOSITE ROOF OF THE COW SHED AND SPEARING HER KNITTING TOGETHER WITH THE LOOSE PIN

2817-142371-0065.flac,FOR AFTER THE FIRST MOMENTS OF STUNNED SURPRISE HE HAD GOT UP AND WAVING HIS HAND TOWARDS HER WITH A SMILE HAD WALKED OUT TOWARDS HIS PONY BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GET AWAY IMMEDIATELY FOR JOHN WAS WALKING THE PONY UP AND DOWN THE YARD

2817-142371-0070.flac,THERE ARE OCCASIONS ON WHICH TWO SERVANT GIRLS AND A WAGGONER MAY BE A FORMIDABLE AUDIENCE AND AS THE SQUIRE RODE AWAY ON HIS BLACK PONY EVEN THE GIFT OF SHORT SIGHTEDNESS DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM BEING AWARE THAT MOLLY
2817-142371-0071.flac,AND THE GANDER HISSING AT A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE PONY'S HEELS CARRIED OUT THE IDEA OF MISSUS POYSER'S SOLO IN AN IMPRESSIVE QUARTET MISSUS POYSER HOWEVER HAD NO SOONER SEEN THE PONY MOVE OFF THAN SHE TURNED ROUND
2817-142371-0072.flac,GAVE THE TWO HILARIOUS DAMSELS A LOOK WHICH DROVE THEM INTO THE BACK KITCHEN AND UNSPEARING HER KNITTING BEGAN TO KNIT AGAIN WITH HER USUAL RAPIDITY AS SHE RE ENTERED THE HOUSE THEE'ST DONE IT NOW SAID MISTER POYSER

2817-142371-0078.flac,AND NOT BY OTHER PEOPLE'S FAULT I'M NONE FOR WORRETING SAID MISTER POYSER RISING FROM HIS THREE CORNERED CHAIR AND WALKING SLOWLY TOWARDS THE DOOR
1743-142912-0000.flac,AND NOW OUR FAMILY IS VERY WELL REPRESENTED IN THE OLD ORCHARD SAID CHEBEC PROUDLY SLOWLY PETER REACHED OVER HIS BACK WITH HIS LONG LEFT HIND FOOT AND THOUGHTFULLY SCRATCHED HIS LONG RIGHT EAR
1743-142912-0001.flac,HE DIDN'T LIKE TO ADMIT THAT HE COULDN'T RECALL THOSE TWO COUSINS OF CHEBEC'S DID YOU SAY YOUR FIGHTING COUSIN HE ASKED IN A HESITATING WAY THAT'S WHAT I SAID REPLIED CHEBEC HE IS SCRAPPER THE KINGBIRD AS OF COURSE YOU KNOW
1743-142912-0002.flac,THE REST OF US ALWAYS FEEL SAFE WHEN HE IS ABOUT OF COURSE I KNOW HIM DECLARED PETER HIS FACE CLEARING WHERE IS HE NOW
1743-142912-0003.flac,AT THAT VERY INSTANT A GREAT RACKET BROKE OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OLD ORCHARD AND IN NO TIME AT ALL THE FEATHERED FOLKS WERE HURRYING FROM EVERY DIRECTION SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES
1743-142912-0004.flac,OF COURSE PETER COULDN'T BE LEFT OUT OF ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND HE SCAMPERED FOR THE SCENE OF TROUBLE AS FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD TAKE HIM
1743-142912-0005.flac,AND THIS WAY AND THAT WAY AS IF TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY FOR A MINUTE PETER COULDN'T THINK WHAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH REDTAIL AND THEN HE SAW
1743-142912-0006.flac,A WHITE THROATED WHITE BREASTED BIRD HAVING A BLACK CAP AND BACK AND A BROAD WHITE BAND ACROSS THE END OF HIS TAIL WAS DARTING AT REDTAIL AS IF HE MEANT TO PULL OUT EVERY FEATHER IN THE LATTER'S COAT
1743-142912-0007.flac,HE WAS JUST A LITTLE SMALLER THAN WELCOME ROBIN AND IN COMPARISON WITH HIM REDTAIL WAS A PERFECT GIANT BUT THIS SEEMED TO MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO SCRAPPER FOR THAT IS WHO IT WAS
1743-142912-0008.flac,HE WASN'T AFRAID AND HE INTENDED THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW IT ESPECIALLY REDTAIL IT IS BECAUSE OF HIS FEARLESSNESS THAT HE IS CALLED KINGBIRD ALL THE TIME HE WAS SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS CALLING REDTAIL A ROBBER AND EVERY OTHER BAD NAME HE COULD THINK OF
1743-142912-0009.flac,ALL THE OTHER BIRDS JOINED HIM IN CALLING REDTAIL BAD NAMES BUT NONE NOT EVEN BULLY THE ENGLISH SPARROW WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO JOIN HIM IN ATTACKING BIG REDTAIL WHEN HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRIVING REDTAIL FAR ENOUGH FROM THE OLD ORCHARD TO SUIT HIM
1743-142912-0010.flac,SCRAPPER FLEW BACK AND PERCHED ON A DEAD BRANCH OF ONE OF THE TREES WHERE HE RECEIVED THE CONGRATULATIONS OF ALL HIS FEATHERED NEIGHBORS HE TOOK THEM QUITE MODESTLY ASSURING THEM THAT HE HAD DONE NOTHING
1743-142912-0011.flac,PETER COULDN'T HELP BUT ADMIRE SCRAPPER FOR HIS COURAGE AS PETER LOOKED UP AT SCRAPPER HE SAW THAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE FLYCATCHERS THERE WAS JUST THE TINIEST OF HOOKS ON THE END OF HIS BILL
1743-142912-0012.flac,SCRAPPER'S SLIGHTLY RAISED CAP SEEMED ALL BLACK BUT IF PETER COULD HAVE GOTTEN CLOSE ENOUGH HE WOULD HAVE FOUND THAT HIDDEN IN IT WAS A PATCH OF ORANGE RED WHILE PETER SAT STARING UP AT HIM SCRAPPER SUDDENLY DARTED OUT INTO THE AIR
1743-142912-0013.flac,AND HIS BILL SNAPPED IN QUITE THE SAME WAY CHEBEC'S DID WHEN HE CAUGHT A FLY BUT IT WASN'T A FLY THAT SCRAPPER HAD IT WAS A BEE PETER SAW IT VERY DISTINCTLY JUST AS SCRAPPER SNAPPED IT UP
1743-142912-0014.flac,IT REMINDED PETER THAT HE HAD OFTEN HEARD SCRAPPER CALLED THE BEE MARTIN AND NOW HE UNDERSTOOD WHY DO YOU LIVE ON BEES ALTOGETHER ASKED PETER
1743-142912-0015.flac,THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY HONEY IF I DID
1743-142912-0016.flac,THOSE THAT I DO CATCH ARE MOSTLY DRONES AND YOU KNOW THE DRONES ARE USELESS THEY DO NO WORK AT ALL IT IS ONLY BY ACCIDENT THAT I NOW AND THEN CATCH A WORKER I EAT ALL KINDS OF INSECTS THAT FLY AND SOME THAT DON'T
1743-142912-0017.flac,I'M ONE OF FARMER BROWN'S BEST FRIENDS IF HE DID BUT KNOW IT YOU CAN TALK ALL YOU PLEASE ABOUT THE WONDERFUL EYESIGHT OF THE MEMBERS OF THE HAWK FAMILY BUT IF ANY ONE OF THEM HAS BETTER EYESIGHT THAN I HAVE I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO IT IS
1743-142912-0018.flac,THERE'S A FLY WAY OVER THERE BEYOND THAT OLD APPLE TREE WATCH ME CATCH IT PETER KNEW BETTER THAN TO WASTE ANY EFFORT TRYING TO SEE THAT FLY HE KNEW THAT HE COULDN'T HAVE SEEN IT HAD IT BEEN ONLY ONE FOURTH THAT DISTANCE AWAY
1743-142912-0019.flac,BUT IF HE COULDN'T SEE THE FLY HE COULD HEAR THE SHARP CLICK OF SCRAPPER'S BILL AND HE KNEW BY THE WAY SCRAPPER KEPT OPENING AND SHUTTING HIS MOUTH AFTER HIS RETURN THAT HE HAD CAUGHT THAT FLY AND IT HAD TASTED GOOD
1743-142912-0020.flac,ARE YOU GOING TO BUILD IN THE OLD ORCHARD THIS YEAR ASKED PETER OF COURSE I AM DECLARED SCRAPPER I JUST THEN HE SPIED BLACKY THE CROW AND DASHED OUT TO MEET HIM
1743-142912-0021.flac,TURNING AWAY TOWARD THE GREEN MEADOWS INSTEAD PETER DIDN'T WAIT FOR SCRAPPER TO RETURN
1743-142912-0022.flac,JUST AS HE WAS LEAVING THE FAR CORNER OF THE OLD ORCHARD SOME ONE CALLED HIM PETER OH PETER RABBIT CALLED THE VOICE PETER STOPPED ABRUPTLY SAT UP VERY STRAIGHT LOOKED THIS WAY LOOKED THAT WAY AND LOOKED THE OTHER WAY
1743-142912-0023.flac,EVERY WAY BUT THE RIGHT WAY LOOK UP OVER YOUR HEAD CRIED THE VOICE RATHER A HARSH VOICE
1743-142912-0024.flac,IT WAS CRESTY THE GREAT CRESTED FLYCATCHER HE WAS A WEE BIT BIGGER THAN SCRAPPER THE KINGBIRD YET NOT QUITE SO BIG AS WELCOME ROBIN AND MORE SLENDER
1743-142912-0025.flac,HIS THROAT AND BREAST WERE GRAY SHADING INTO BRIGHT YELLOW UNDERNEATH HIS BACK AND HEAD WERE OF A GRAYISH BROWN WITH A TINT OF OLIVE GREEN A POINTED CAP WAS ALL THAT WAS NEEDED TO MAKE HIM QUITE DISTINGUISHED LOOKING
1743-142912-0026.flac,YOU SEEM TO BE IN A HURRY SO DON'T LET ME DETAIN YOU PETER SAID CRESTY BEFORE PETER COULD FIND HIS TONGUE I JUST WANT TO ASK ONE LITTLE FAVOR OF YOU WHAT IS IT ASKED PETER WHO

1743-142912-0029.flac,CAST OFF SNAKE SUITS BEFORE PETER COULD SAY ANOTHER WORD CRESTY HAD FLOWN AWAY PETER HESITATED LOOKING FIRST TOWARDS THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH AND THEN TOWARDS JENNY WREN'S HOUSE
1743-142912-0030.flac,HE JUST COULDN'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THOSE CAST OFF SUITS OF THE SNAKE FAMILY AND HE FELT SURE THAT JENNY WREN COULD TELL HIM FINALLY CURIOSITY GOT THE BEST OF HIM AND BACK HE SCAMPERED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP TO THE FOOT OF THE TREE IN WHICH JENNY WREN HAD HER HOME
1743-142912-0031.flac,JENNY CALLED PETER JENNY WREN JENNY WREN NO ONE ANSWERED HIM HE COULD HEAR MISTER WREN SINGING IN ANOTHER TREE BUT HE COULDN'T SEE HIM JENNY JENNY WREN JENNY WREN CALLED PETER AGAIN
1743-142912-0032.flac,THIS TIME JENNY POPPED HER HEAD OUT AND HER LITTLE EYES FAIRLY SNAPPED DIDN'T I TELL YOU THE OTHER DAY PETER RABBIT THAT I'M NOT TO BE DISTURBED DIDN'T I TELL YOU THAT I'VE GOT SEVEN EGGS IN HERE AND THAT I CAN'T SPEND ANY TIME GOSSIPING
1743-142912-0033.flac,DIDN'T I PETER RABBIT DIDN'T I DIDN'T I YOU CERTAINLY DID JENNY YOU CERTAINLY DID AND I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU REPLIED PETER MEEKLY I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT OF DOING SUCH A THING BUT I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHO ELSE TO GO TO
1743-142912-0034.flac,GO TO FOR WHAT SNAPPED JENNY WREN WHAT IS IT YOU'VE COME TO ME FOR SNAKE SKINS REPLIED PETER SNAKE SKINS SNAKE SKINS SHRIEKED JENNY WREN
1743-142912-0035.flac,YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND CRIED PETER HURRIEDLY WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHY SHOULD CRESTY THE FLYCATCHER ASK ME TO PLEASE LET HIM KNOW IF I FOUND ANY CAST OFF SUITS OF THE SNAKE FAMILY
1743-142912-0036.flac,HE FLEW AWAY BEFORE I COULD ASK HIM WHY HE WANTS THEM AND SO I CAME TO YOU BECAUSE I KNOW YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ESPECIALLY EVERYTHING CONCERNING YOUR NEIGHBORS
1743-142913-0000.flac,WITH THIS JENNY WREN DISAPPEARED INSIDE HER HOUSE AND THERE WAS NOTHING FOR PETER TO DO BUT ONCE MORE START FOR THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH ON HIS WAY HE COULDN'T RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO RUN OVER TO THE GREEN FOREST WHICH WAS JUST BEYOND THE OLD ORCHARD
1743-142913-0001.flac,HE JUST HAD TO FIND OUT IF THERE WAS ANYTHING NEW OVER THERE HARDLY HAD HE REACHED IT WHEN HE HEARD A PLAINTIVE VOICE CRYING PEE WEE PEE WEE PEE WEE PETER CHUCKLED HAPPILY
1743-142913-0002.flac,HE USUALLY IS ONE OF THE LAST OF THE FLYCATCHER FAMILY TO ARRIVE I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND HIM YET I WONDER WHAT HAS BROUGHT HIM UP SO EARLY
1743-142913-0003.flac,IT DIDN'T TAKE PETER LONG TO FIND PEWEE HE JUST FOLLOWED THE SOUND OF THAT VOICE AND PRESENTLY SAW PEWEE FLY OUT AND MAKE THE SAME KIND OF A LITTLE CIRCLE AS THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY MAKE WHEN THEY ARE HUNTING FLIES
1743-142913-0004.flac,IT ENDED JUST WHERE IT HAD STARTED ON A DEAD TWIG OF A TREE IN A SHADY RATHER LONELY PART OF THE GREEN FOREST ALMOST AT ONCE HE BEGAN TO CALL HIS NAME IN A RATHER SAD PLAINTIVE TONE PEE WEE PEE WEE PEE WEE
1743-142913-0005.flac,BUT HE WASN'T SAD AS PETER WELL KNEW IT WAS HIS WAY OF EXPRESSING HOW HAPPY HE FELT HE WAS A LITTLE BIGGER THAN HIS COUSIN CHEBEC BUT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE HIM THERE WAS A LITTLE NOTCH IN THE END OF HIS TAIL
1743-142913-0006.flac,THE UPPER HALF OF HIS BILL WAS BLACK BUT THE LOWER HALF WAS LIGHT PETER COULD SEE ON EACH WING TWO WHITISH BARS AND HE NOTICED THAT PEWEE'S WINGS WERE LONGER THAN HIS TAIL WHICH WASN'T THE CASE WITH CHEBEC
1743-142913-0007.flac,BUT NO ONE COULD EVER MISTAKE PEWEE FOR ANY OF HIS RELATIVES FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT HE KEEPS REPEATING HIS OWN NAME OVER AND OVER AREN'T YOU HERE EARLY ASKED PETER PEWEE NODDED
1743-142913-0008.flac,THAT IS SOMETHING I DON'T OFTEN DO IF YOU PLEASE PETER INQUIRED POLITELY WHY DO FOLKS CALL YOU WOOD PEWEE PEWEE CHUCKLED HAPPILY
1743-142913-0009.flac,IT IS SO QUIET AND RESTFUL THAT I LOVE IT MISSUS PEWEE AND I ARE VERY RETIRING WE DO NOT LIKE TOO MANY NEAR NEIGHBORS YOU WON'T MIND IF I COME TO SEE YOU ONCE IN A WHILE WILL YOU ASKED PETER AS HE PREPARED TO START ON AGAIN FOR THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH
1743-142913-0010.flac,COME AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE REPLIED PEWEE THE OFTENER THE BETTER BACK IN THE OLD BRIAR PATCH PETER THOUGHT OVER ALL HE HAD LEARNED ABOUT THE FLYCATCHER FAMILY AND AS HE RECALLED HOW THEY WERE FOREVER CATCHING ALL SORTS OF FLYING INSECTS IT SUDDENLY STRUCK HIM
1743-142913-0011.flac,THAT THEY MUST BE VERY USEFUL LITTLE PEOPLE IN HELPING OLD MOTHER NATURE TAKE CARE OF HER TREES AND OTHER GROWING THINGS WHICH INSECTS SO DEARLY LOVE TO DESTROY
1743-142913-0012.flac,BUT MOST OF ALL PETER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT QUEER REQUEST OF CRESTY'S AND A DOZEN TIMES THAT DAY HE FOUND HIMSELF PEEPING UNDER OLD LOGS IN THE HOPE OF FINDING A CAST OFF COAT OF MISTER BLACK SNAKE
1743-142913-0013.flac,IT WAS SUCH A FUNNY THING FOR CRESTY TO ASK FOR THAT PETER'S CURIOSITY WOULD ALLOW HIM NO PEACE AND THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS UP IN THE OLD ORCHARD BEFORE JOLLY MISTER SUN HAD KICKED HIS BEDCLOTHES OFF
1743-142913-0014.flac,JENNY WREN WAS AS GOOD AS HER WORD WHILE SHE FLITTED AND HOPPED ABOUT THIS WAY AND THAT WAY IN THAT FUSSY WAY OF HERS GETTING HER BREAKFAST SHE TALKED JENNY COULDN'T KEEP HER TONGUE STILL IF SHE WANTED TO DID YOU FIND ANY OLD CLOTHES OF THE SNAKE FAMILY SHE DEMANDED
1743-142913-0015.flac,THEN AS PETER SHOOK HIS HEAD HER TONGUE RAN ON WITHOUT WAITING FOR HIM TO REPLY CRESTY AND HIS WIFE ALWAYS INSIST UPON HAVING A PIECE OF SNAKE SKIN IN THEIR NEST SAID SHE WHY THEY WANT IT GOODNESS KNOWS BUT
1743-142913-0016.flac,PERHAPS THEY THINK IT WILL SCARE ROBBERS AWAY AS FOR ME I SHOULD HAVE A COLD CHILL EVERY TIME I GOT INTO MY NEST IF I HAD TO SIT ON ANYTHING LIKE THAT I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT CRESTY AND HIS WIFE ARE A HANDSOME COUPLE
1743-142913-0017.flac,AND THEY CERTAINLY HAVE GOOD SENSE IN CHOOSING A HOUSE MORE SENSE THAN ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY TO MY WAY OF THINKING BUT SNAKE SKINS UGH BY THE WAY WHERE DOES CRESTY BUILD ASKED PETER
1743-142913-0018.flac,IN A HOLE IN A TREE LIKE THE REST OF US SENSIBLE PEOPLE RETORTED JENNY WREN PROMPTLY PETER LOOKED QUITE AS SURPRISED AS HE FELT DOES CRESTY MAKE THE HOLE HE ASKED GOODNESS GRACIOUS NO EXCLAIMED JENNY WREN
1743-142913-0019.flac,WHERE ARE YOUR EYES PETER DID YOU EVER SEE A FLYCATCHER WITH A BILL THAT LOOKED AS IF IT COULD CUT WOOD SHE DIDN'T WAIT FOR A REPLY BUT RATTLED ON IT IS A GOOD THING FOR A LOT OF US THAT THE WOODPECKER FAMILY ARE SO FOND OF NEW HOUSES LOOK
1743-142913-0020.flac,THERE IS DOWNY THE WOODPECKER HARD AT WORK ON A NEW HOUSE THIS VERY MINUTE THAT'S GOOD I LIKE TO SEE THAT IT MEANS THAT NEXT YEAR THERE WILL BE ONE MORE HOUSE FOR SOME ONE HERE IN THE OLD ORCHARD FOR MYSELF I PREFER OLD HOUSES
1743-142913-0021.flac,I'VE NOTICED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MY NEIGHBORS WHO FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT IT THERE IS SOMETHING SETTLED ABOUT AN OLD HOUSE IT DOESN'T ATTRACT ATTENTION THE WAY A NEW ONE DOES SO LONG AS IT HAS GOT REASONABLY GOOD WALLS AND THE RAIN AND THE WIND CAN'T GET IN
1743-142913-0022.flac,THE OLDER IT IS THE BETTER IT SUITS ME BUT THE WOODPECKERS SEEM TO LIKE NEW HOUSES BEST WHICH AS I SAID BEFORE IS A VERY GOOD THING FOR THE REST OF US
1743-142913-0023.flac,WINSOME BLUEBIRD STUPID SNAPPED JENNY WREN PETER GRINNED AND LOOKED FOOLISH OF COURSE SAID HE I FORGOT ALL ABOUT WINSOME AND SKIMMER THE TREE SWALLOW ADDED JENNY THAT'S SO I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED HIM EXCLAIMED PETER
1743-142913-0024.flac,I'VE NOTICED THAT HE IS VERY FOND OF THE SAME HOUSE YEAR AFTER YEAR IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE AGAIN JENNY WREN NODDED YANK YANK THE NUTHATCH USES AN OLD HOUSE I'M TOLD BUT HE USUALLY GOES UP NORTH FOR HIS NESTING SAID SHE
1743-142913-0025.flac,TOMMY TIT THE CHICKADEE SOMETIMES USES AN OLD HOUSE THEN AGAIN HE AND MISSUS CHICKADEE GET FUSSY AND MAKE A HOUSE FOR THEMSELVES YELLOW WING THE FLICKER WHO REALLY IS A WOODPECKER OFTEN USES AN OLD HOUSE BUT QUITE OFTEN MAKES A NEW ONE
1743-142913-0026.flac,THEN THERE ARE KILLY THE SPARROW HAWK AND SPOOKY THE SCREECH OWL PETER LOOKED SURPRISED I DIDN'T SUPPOSE THEY NESTED IN HOLES IN TREES HE EXCLAIMED THEY CERTAINLY DO MORE'S THE PITY SNAPPED JENNY
1743-142913-0027.flac,IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR THE REST OF US IF THEY DIDN'T NEST AT ALL BUT THEY DO AND AN OLD HOUSE OF YELLOW WING THE FLICKER SUITS EITHER OF THEM KILLY ALWAYS USES ONE THAT IS HIGH UP AND COMES BACK TO IT YEAR AFTER YEAR
1743-142913-0028.flac,SPOOKY ISN'T PARTICULAR SO LONG AS THE HOUSE IS BIG ENOUGH TO BE COMFORTABLE HE LIVES IN IT MORE OR LESS THE YEAR AROUND NOW I MUST GET BACK TO THOSE EGGS OF MINE I'VE TALKED QUITE ENOUGH FOR ONE MORNING OH JENNY CRIED PETER AS A SUDDEN THOUGHT STRUCK HIM
1743-142913-0029.flac,JENNY PAUSED AND JERKED HER TAIL IMPATIENTLY WELL WHAT IS IT NOW SHE DEMANDED HAVE YOU GOT TWO HOMES ASKED PETER GOODNESS GRACIOUS NO EXCLAIMED JENNY
1743-142913-0030.flac,ONE IS ALL I CAN TAKE CARE OF THEN WHY DEMANDED PETER TRIUMPHANTLY DOES MISTER WREN WORK ALL DAY CARRYING STICKS AND STRAWS INTO A HOLE IN ANOTHER TREE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE HAS CARRIED ENOUGH IN THERE TO BUILD TWO OR THREE NESTS
1743-142914-0000.flac,HE WASN'T READY TO GO BACK HOME TO THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH YET THERE SEEMED NOTHING ELSE TO DO FOR EVERYBODY IN THE OLD ORCHARD WAS TOO BUSY FOR IDLE GOSSIP PETER SCRATCHED A LONG EAR WITH A LONG HIND FOOT TRYING TO THINK OF SOME PLACE TO GO
1743-142914-0001.flac,I'LL JUST RUN OVER AND PAY MY RESPECTS TO GRANDFATHER FROG AND TO REDWING THE BLACKBIRD REDWING WAS ONE OF THE FIRST BIRDS TO ARRIVE AND I'VE NEGLECTED HIM SHAMEFULLY WHEN PETER THINKS OF SOMETHING TO DO HE WASTES NO TIME
1743-142914-0002.flac,OFF HE STARTED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP FOR THE SMILING POOL HE KEPT CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST UNTIL HE REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE LAUGHING BROOK COMES OUT OF THE GREEN FOREST ON ITS WAY TO THE SMILING POOL IN THE GREEN MEADOWS
1743-142914-0003.flac,BUSHES AND YOUNG TREES GROW ALONG THE BANKS OF THE LAUGHING BROOK AT THIS POINT THE GROUND WAS SOFT IN PLACES QUITE MUDDY PETER DOESN'T MIND GETTING HIS FEET DAMP SO HE HOPPED ALONG CARELESSLY
1743-142914-0004.flac,FROM RIGHT UNDER HIS VERY NOSE SOMETHING SHOT UP INTO THE AIR WITH A WHISTLING SOUND IT STARTLED PETER SO THAT HE STOPPED SHORT WITH HIS EYES POPPING OUT OF HIS HEAD
1743-142914-0005.flac,HE HAD JUST A GLIMPSE OF A BROWN FORM DISAPPEARING OVER THE TOPS OF SOME TALL BUSHES THEN PETER CHUCKLED
1743-142914-0006.flac,HE SCARED ME FOR A SECOND THEN YOU ARE EVEN SAID A VOICE CLOSE AT HAND YOU SCARED HIM I SAW YOU COMING BUT LONGBILL DIDN'T PETER TURNED QUICKLY THERE WAS MISSUS WOODCOCK PEEPING AT HIM FROM BEHIND A TUSSOCK OF GRASS
1743-142914-0007.flac,I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE HIM APOLOGIZED PETER I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO DO YOU THINK HE WAS REALLY VERY MUCH SCARED
1743-142914-0008.flac,I RECOGNIZED YOU JUST AS I WAS DISAPPEARING OVER THE TOPS OF THE BUSHES SO I CAME RIGHT BACK I LEARNED WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG THAT WHEN STARTLED IT IS BEST TO FLY FIRST AND FIND OUT AFTERWARDS WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS REAL DANGER
1743-142914-0009.flac,I AM GLAD IT IS NO ONE BUT YOU PETER FOR I WAS HAVING A SPLENDID MEAL HERE AND I SHOULD HAVE HATED TO LEAVE IT YOU'LL EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO ON EATING I HOPE WE CAN TALK BETWEEN BITES
1743-142914-0010.flac,CERTAINLY I'LL EXCUSE YOU REPLIED PETER STARING AROUND VERY HARD TO SEE WHAT IT COULD BE LONGBILL WAS MAKING SUCH A GOOD MEAL OF BUT PETER COULDN'T SEE A THING THAT LOOKED GOOD TO EAT THERE WASN'T EVEN A BUG OR A WORM CRAWLING ON THE GROUND
1743-142914-0011.flac,LONGBILL TOOK TWO OR THREE STEPS IN RATHER A STATELY FASHION PETER HAD TO HIDE A SMILE FOR LONGBILL HAD SUCH AN AIR OF IMPORTANCE YET AT THE SAME TIME WAS SUCH AN ODD LOOKING FELLOW
1743-142914-0012.flac,HE WAS QUITE A LITTLE BIGGER THAN WELCOME ROBIN HIS TAIL WAS SHORT HIS LEGS WERE SHORT AND HIS NECK WAS SHORT BUT HIS BILL WAS LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE UP
1743-142914-0013.flac,HIS BACK WAS A MIXTURE OF GRAY BROWN BLACK AND BUFF WHILE HIS BREAST AND UNDER PARTS WERE A BEAUTIFUL REDDISH BUFF IT WAS HIS HEAD THAT MADE HIM LOOK QUEER
1743-142914-0014.flac,HIS EYES WERE VERY BIG AND THEY WERE SET SO FAR BACK THAT PETER WONDERED IF IT WASN'T EASIER FOR HIM TO LOOK BEHIND HIM THAN IN FRONT OF HIM SUDDENLY LONGBILL PLUNGED HIS BILL INTO THE GROUND HE PLUNGED IT IN FOR THE WHOLE LENGTH
1743-142914-0015.flac,THEN HE PULLED IT OUT AND PETER CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE TAIL END OF A WORM DISAPPEARING DOWN LONGBILL'S THROAT WHERE THAT LONG BILL HAD GONE INTO THE GROUND WAS A NEAT LITTLE ROUND HOLE
1743-142914-0016.flac,FOR THE FIRST TIME PETER NOTICED THAT THERE WERE MANY SUCH LITTLE ROUND HOLES ALL ABOUT DID YOU MAKE ALL THOSE LITTLE ROUND HOLES EXCLAIMED PETER
1743-142914-0017.flac,AND WAS THERE A WORM IN EVERY ONE ASKED PETER HIS EYES VERY WIDE WITH INTEREST LONGBILL NODDED
1743-142914-0018.flac,PETER REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD WATCHED WELCOME ROBIN LISTEN AND THEN SUDDENLY PLUNGE HIS BILL INTO THE GROUND AND PULL OUT A WORM BUT THE WORMS WELCOME ROBIN GOT WERE ALWAYS CLOSE TO THE SURFACE
1743-142914-0019.flac,WHILE THESE WORMS WERE SO DEEP IN THE EARTH THAT PETER COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE THERE
1743-142914-0020.flac,AND HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO OPEN YOUR BILL DOWN THERE TO TAKE HIM IN ASKED PETER LONGBILL CHUCKLED
1743-142914-0021.flac,LONGBILL SUDDENLY THRUST HIS BILL STRAIGHT OUT IN FRONT OF HIM AND TO PETER'S ASTONISHMENT HE LIFTED THE END OF THE UPPER HALF WITHOUT OPENING THE REST OF HIS BILL AT ALL THAT'S THE WAY I GET THEM SAID HE
1743-142914-0022.flac,I THINK THERE IS ONE RIGHT UNDER MY FEET NOW WATCH ME GET HIM LONGBILL BORED INTO THE GROUND UNTIL HIS HEAD WAS ALMOST AGAINST IT WHEN HE PULLED HIS BILL OUT SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A WORM OF COURSE EXPLAINED LONGBILL IT IS ONLY IN SOFT GROUND THAT I CAN DO THIS
1743-142914-0023.flac,THAT IS WHY I HAVE TO FLY AWAY SOUTH AS SOON AS THE GROUND FREEZES AT ALL IT'S WONDERFUL SIGHED PETER I DON'T SUPPOSE ANY ONE ELSE CAN FIND HIDDEN WORMS THAT WAY MY COUSIN JACK SNIPE CAN REPLIED LONGBILL PROMPTLY
1743-142914-0024.flac,HE FEEDS THE SAME WAY I DO ONLY HE LIKES MARSHY MEADOWS INSTEAD OF BRUSHY SWAMPS PERHAPS YOU KNOW HIM PETER NODDED I DO SAID HE NOW YOU SPEAK OF IT THERE IS A STRONG FAMILY RESEMBLANCE ALTHOUGH I HADN'T THOUGHT OF HIM AS A RELATIVE OF YOURS BEFORE
1743-142914-0025.flac,NOW I MUST BE RUNNING ALONG I'M EVER SO GLAD TO HAVE SEEN YOU AND I'M COMING OVER TO CALL AGAIN THE FIRST CHANCE I GET SO PETER SAID GOOD BY AND KEPT ON DOWN THE LAUGHING BROOK TO THE SMILING POOL RIGHT WHERE THE LAUGHING BROOK ENTERED THE SMILING POOL
1743-142914-0026.flac,THERE WAS A LITTLE PEBBLY BEACH RUNNING ALONG THE VERY EDGE OF THE WATER WAS A SLIM TRIM LITTLE BIRD WITH FAIRLY LONG LEGS A LONG SLENDER BILL BROWNISH GRAY BACK WITH BLACK SPOTS AND MARKINGS AND A WHITE WAISTCOAT NEATLY SPOTTED WITH BLACK
1743-142914-0027.flac,EVERY FEW STEPS HE WOULD STOP TO PICK UP SOMETHING THEN STAND FOR A SECOND BOBBING UP AND DOWN IN THE FUNNIEST WAY AS IF HIS BODY WAS SO NICELY BALANCED ON HIS LEGS THAT IT TEETERED BACK AND FORTH LIKE A SEESAW
1743-142914-0028.flac,IT WAS TEETER THE SPOTTED SANDPIPER AN OLD FRIEND OF PETER'S PETER GREETED HIM JOYOUSLY
1743-142914-0029.flac,BEFORE PETER COULD SAY ANOTHER WORD TEETER CAME RUNNING TOWARDS HIM AND IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT TEETER WAS VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING DON'T MOVE PETER RABBIT DON'T MOVE HE CRIED WHY NOT DEMANDED PETER FOR HE COULD SEE NO DANGER AND COULD THINK OF NO REASON WHY HE SHOULDN'T MOVE
1743-142914-0030.flac,JUST THEN MISSUS TEETER CAME HURRYING UP AND SQUATTED DOWN IN THE SAND RIGHT IN FRONT OF PETER THANK GOODNESS EXCLAIMED TEETER STILL BOBBING AND BOWING IF YOU HAD TAKEN ANOTHER STEP PETER RABBIT YOU WOULD HAVE STEPPED RIGHT ON OUR EGGS YOU GAVE ME A DREADFUL START
1743-142914-0031.flac,MISSUS TEETER STOOD UP AND STEPPED ASIDE THEN PETER SAW RIGHT IN A LITTLE HOLLOW IN THE SAND WITH JUST A FEW BITS OF GRASS FOR A LINING FOUR WHITE EGGS WITH BIG DARK BLOTCHES ON THEM
1743-142914-0032.flac,THEY LOOKED SO MUCH LIKE THE SURROUNDING PEBBLES THAT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE SEEN THEM IN THE WORLD BUT FOR MISSUS TEETER PETER HASTILY BACKED AWAY A FEW STEPS MISSUS TEETER SLIPPED BACK ON THE EGGS AND SETTLED HERSELF COMFORTABLY
1743-142914-0033.flac,IT SUDDENLY STRUCK PETER THAT IF HE HADN'T SEEN HER DO IT HE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN SHE WAS THERE
1743-142914-0034.flac,MY HE EXCLAIMED I CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE STEPPED ON THOSE EGGS IF YOU HADN'T WARNED ME SAID HE I'M SO THANKFUL I DIDN'T I DON'T SEE HOW YOU DARE LAY THEM IN THE OPEN LIKE THIS
8747-293952-0000.flac,THINGS WENT VERY SMOOTHLY AT GORE HALL AFTER DURHAM HAD ESTABLISHED LUCY AS ITS MISTRESS DURING THE ABSENCE OF BERNARD THE GIRL HERSELF FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT HER COUSIN WAS DEAD AND ASSUMED DEEP MOURNING
8747-293952-0001.flac,AND FELT HIS LOSS DEEPLY IT WAS HER OUTSPOKEN AFFECTION THAT PROVOKED A QUARREL BETWEEN HER AND JULIUS AND WHICH LED TO THE BREAKING OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT LUCY HAD A HIGH TEMPER WHICH HAD BEEN KEPT IN SUBJECTION DURING THE LIFE OF SIR SIMON
8747-293952-0002.flac,BUT NOW THAT SHE TASTED THE SWEETS OF POWER SHE WAS NOT DISPOSED TO ALLOW JULIUS TO TREAT HER AS HE CHOSE MISSUS GILROY CAME BACK FROM HER VISIT TO THE LAWYER
8747-293952-0003.flac,SHE SAW THAT SHE HAD GONE TOO FAR AND HAD GIVEN DURHAM AN INKLING AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MICHAEL HAVING MASQUERADED AS BERNARD
8747-293952-0004.flac,KNOWING THAT SHE HAD MARRIED WALTER GORE AND ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A FLAW IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES UPON WHICH SHE BUILT HER CLAIM YET SHE TRUSTED TO HER OWN CLEVERNESS TO CONCEAL THIS FROM THE TOO CLEVER LAWYER BUT APART FROM THIS
8747-293952-0005.flac,THE FACT THAT HE SUSPECTED SOMEONE OF PASSING HIMSELF OFF AS BERNARD STARTLED HER AND OPENED AN ABYSS AT HER FEET ON LEAVING THE OFFICE SHE JUDGED IT BEST TO LOWER HER CREST FOR THE MOMENT AND TO WAIT PATIENTLY TO SEE WHAT WOULD TRANSPIRE
8747-293952-0006.flac,MISSUS GILROY WAS A WELL EDUCATED WOMAN AND VERY ASTUTE THEREFORE SHE HOPED TO GAIN HER ENDS BY CRAFT IF NOT BY FORCE SO FAR SHE HAD FAILED BUT SHE DID NOT INTEND TO ABANDON HER CLAIM
8747-293952-0007.flac,FOR ONE FAILURE AS IT WAS SHE CAME BACK TO THE HALL AND BEHAVED HERSELF MUCH BETTER THAN SHE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE SHE WAS RESPECTFUL TO LUCY AND DID NOT DISPLAY HER IMPATIENCE OF COMMANDS THAT
8747-293952-0008.flac,SHE HAD HITHERTO DONE NO ONE COULD HAVE BEEN MEEKER AND ALTHOUGH MISS RANDOLPH DID NOT LIKE OR TRUST THE WOMAN SHE HAD NO FAULT TO FIND WITH HER IN ANY WAY LUCY SUFFERED SEVERELY FROM THE SHOCK OF SIR SIMON'S TRAGIC DEATH
8747-293952-0009.flac,AND FROM THE SUPPOSED DEATH OF SIR BERNARD IN FACT THE MATTER SO PREYED ON HER NERVES THAT SHE BECAME PROSTRATE AND DOCTOR PAYNE HAD TO BE CALLED IN HE WAS A HANDSOME AND POPULAR YOUNG DOCTOR WHO HAD PRACTICED IN HURSETON
8747-293952-0010.flac,HE WAS NATURALLY VERY PLEASED AND WAS VERY ATTENTIVE A COMPLETE REST IS WHAT YOU NEED HE SAID TO MISS RANDOLPH
8747-293952-0011.flac,AND I WILL GIVE YOU A TONIC NATURALLY YOU SUFFER FROM THE TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SIR SIMON'S DEATH HE THOUGHT A MOMENT
8747-293952-0012.flac,A CHEERFUL COMPANION WOULD DO YOU GOOD SHALL I ASK MISS MALLESON TO COME OVER IS SHE CHEERFUL ASKED LUCY LANGUIDLY I FEAR NOT DOCTOR SHE WAS ENGAGED TO MY COUSIN AND HIS DEATH HAS MADE HER SAD
8747-293952-0013.flac,PROBABLY BUT SHE BEARS UP WONDERFULLY BUT THAT SHE IS IN MOURNING ONE WOULD HARDLY GUESS SHE HAD SUSTAINED SUCH A LOSS WAS SHE VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MISTER GORE YES
8747-293952-0014.flac,I NEVER SAW A MORE ATTACHED COUPLE DID YOU EVER MEET HIM ONCE AT MISS PLANTAGENET'S YOU KNOW I AM GREAT FRIENDS WITH THE OLD LADY I OFTEN VISIT HER NOT PROFESSIONALLY FOR SHE IS AS HEALTHY AS A TROUT IN A POND
8747-293952-0015.flac,IS ALICE MISS MALLESON ALSO WELL IN VERY GOOD HEALTH AND APPEARS RESIGNED TO HER LOSS I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE FELT IT MORE SAID LUCY PERPLEXED
8747-293952-0016.flac,ALICE HAS SUCH A TENDER HEART DOCTOR PAYNE WAS DOUBTFUL SO FAR AS HE SAW MISS MALLESON WAS REMARKABLY CHEERFUL UNDER HER SORROW SHE IS PHILOSOPHIC MISS RANDOLPH
8747-293952-0017.flac,I THINK HOWEVER IF YOU WOULD HAVE HER OVER TO SEE YOU IT WOULD DO BOTH HER AND YOURSELF GOOD I SHALL WRITE A NOTE TO HER TO DAY SAID LUCY I AM VERY FOND OF HER AND WE GET ON VERY WELL TOGETHER
8747-293952-0018.flac,POOR ALICE I WISH BERNARD HAD LIVED
8747-293952-0019.flac,RISING TO TAKE HIS LEAVE IF HE WAS GUILTY AH SAID LUCY RAISING HERSELF WITH ANIMATION FROM THE SOFA UPON WHICH SHE WAS LYING IF HE WAS GUILTY
8747-293952-0020.flac,I DO NOT BELIEVE HE WAS
8747-293952-0021.flac,BUT HE COULD NOT ALWAYS CONTROL IT AND WAS A KIND HEARTED BOY HE IS INNOCENT I AM SURE HOW ARE YOU SURE MY DEAR LUCY ASKED A THIRD VOICE AND SHE LOOKED UP TO SEE JULIUS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY
8747-293952-0022.flac,HE CAME FORWARD FORGIVE ME IF I HEARD A FEW WORDS OF YOUR CONVERSATION BUT I HAVE JUST COME IN DOCTOR PAYNE I HOPE I SEE YOU WELL QUITE WELL SAID THE DOCTOR WHO DID NOT LIKE BERYL THINKING HIM
8747-293952-0023.flac,IN SCHOOLBOY PHRASE A SNEAK I AM JUST GOING MISTER BERYL ARE YOU ILL LUCY ASKED BERYL WITH AFFECTION I HAVE AN ATTACK OF NERVES SHE REPLIED PETTISHLY
8747-293952-0024.flac,POOR BERNARD'S DEATH HAS SHAKEN ME IT IS JUST AS WELL HE DID DIE THOUGH I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT SAID PAYNE BUT I MUST TAKE MY LEAVE I WILL COME AND SEE YOU AGAIN MISS RANDOLPH AND REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU
8747-293952-0025.flac,REST AND CHEERFUL COMPANY MISS MALLESON'S FOR CHOICE HE DEPARTED SMILING AND THEY HEARD HIM GALLOP OFF WHEN THE SOUND OF THE HORSE'S HOOFS DIED AWAY
8747-293952-0026.flac,WHY DO YOU THINK BERNARD IS INNOCENT HE ASKED BECAUSE IF HE IS GUILTY HIS ACTION GIVES THE LIE TO HIS WHOLE LIFE JULIUS SHE REPLIED RAISING HERSELF ON HER ELBOW I CAN'T BELIEVE HE KILLED MY UNCLE
8747-293952-0027.flac,SIR SIMON IS NOT YOUR UNCLE SAID BERYL JEALOUSLY YOU ARE ONLY A DISTANT RELATIVE PERHAPS MY MARRIAGE WITH YOU MAY MAKE ME A NEARER ONE
8747-293952-0028.flac,IF WE EVER DO MARRY SAID JULIUS GLOOMILY SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I SHOULD LIKE TO BREAK THE ENGAGEMENT JULIUS WE WERE NEVER SUITED TO ONE ANOTHER BERYL'S VANITY WAS HURT
8747-293952-0029.flac,WHY DID YOU ACCEPT ME THEN WHAT ELSE COULD I DO IT WAS SIR SIMON'S WISH THAT WE SHOULD MARRY AND OWING TO MY CIRCUMSTANCES I HAD NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER DURING HIS LIFE I WAS MERELY A PUPPET
8747-293952-0030.flac,ALTHOUGH YOU SWORE FOR AN HOUR
8747-293952-0031.flac,YOU TOLD SIR SIMON ABOUT BERNARD BEING IN LOVE WITH ALICE THAT THE POOR BOY MIGHT BE DISINHERITED BERYL DID NOT DENY THE CHARGE I BELIEVE YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH BERNARD YOURSELF HE SAID
8747-293952-0032.flac,NO BERNARD AND I ARE LIKE BROTHER AND SISTER BUT HE IS DEAD
8747-293952-0033.flac,LUCY SAT UP ON THE SOFA AND PUSHED THE LOOSE HAIR BACK FROM HER FOREHEAD WHY DO YOU SAY THAT SHE ASKED SHARPLY JULIUS STARED AT THE FIRE I CAN'T UNDERSTAND DURHAM'S ATTITUDE HE SAID EVASIVELY
8747-293952-0034.flac,HE MUST KNOW THAT BERNARD IS DEAD SEEING THAT THE COAT AND HAT WERE FOUND ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER NO MAN COULD HAVE LIVED IN THE COLD AND THE FOG YET IF DURHAM WAS SURE HE WOULD NOT HOLD THE ESTATE AGAINST BERNARD'S COMING
8747-293952-0035.flac,MISTER DURHAM REQUIRES PROOF OF THE DEATH REJOINED LUCY SHARPLY AND UNTIL THEN HE IS BOUND TO ADMINISTER THE ESTATE ACCORDING TO THE WILL AS BERNARD'S BODY HAS NOT BEEN FOUND
8747-293952-0036.flac,THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT HE MAY HAVE ESCAPED I SINCERELY TRUST NOT AH YOU ALWAYS HATED BERNARD ON THE CONTRARY I SPEAK FOR HIS GOOD
8747-293952-0037.flac,WHAT'S THE USE OF HIS COMING TO LIFE WHEN HE MUST SUFFER FOR HIS CRIME
8747-293952-0038.flac,YOU HAVE NO GROUNDS FOR SAYING THAT SAID JULIUS PALE WITH RAGE I DON'T NEED GROUNDS RETORTED THE GENUINE WOMAN BERNARD ALWAYS WAS AS KIND HEARTED AS YOU WERE AND ARE THE REVERSE

8747-293952-0045.flac,MISS PLANTAGENET WANTS A PAGE I FOUND THIS LAD IN LONDON SELLING MATCHES HE WAS A MESSENGER BOY AT A TOBACCONIST CALLED TABERLEY AND LORD CONNISTON GOT HIM TURNED OUT OF THE SITUATION
8747-293952-0046.flac,THE BOY TOLD ME HIMSELF HE WILL TELL YOU IF YOU LIKE TO SEE HIM I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM LORD CONNISTON IS TOO KIND A MAN TO BEHAVE IN THAT WAY HE WAS FOND OF BERNARD
8747-293952-0047.flac,AND THAT MAKES HIM PERFECT IN YOUR EYES SAID BERYL LOOKING SAVAGE SEE HERE LUCY CONNISTON HAS LEFT THE ARMY SO YOU SEE HE IS NOT SO BRAVE AS YOU THINK
8747-293952-0048.flac,HE LEFT SO AS TO SEEK AFTER BERNARD SAID LUCY QUICKLY MISTER DURHAM TOLD ME SO
8747-293952-0049.flac,AND I BELIEVE BERNARD MAY BE ALIVE AFTER ALL IN WHICH CASE YOU WOULD GIVE HIM UP TO THE POLICE NO SAID JULIUS WITH AN EMOTION WHICH DID HIM CREDIT I SHOULD NEVER BETRAY HIM
8747-293952-0050.flac,LUCY IF YOU CAN FIND OUT FROM LORD CONNISTON OR DURHAM THAT BERNARD IS ALIVE LET ME KNOW AND I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO HELP HIM HOW CAN YOU HELP HIM WHEN YOU BELIEVE HIM GUILTY I MIGHT HELP HIM TO ESCAPE
8747-293952-0051.flac,I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM HANGED HE WON'T BE HANGED IF LORD CONNISTON AND MISTER DURHAM CAN SAVE HIM AH JULIUS STARTED TO HIS FEET THEN HE IS ALIVE
8747-293952-0052.flac,I CAN'T SAY I HAVE NO REASON TO THINK HE IS BUT I AM HOPING AGAINST HOPE SAID LUCY RISING I MERELY STATE WHAT WAS SAID MISTER DURHAM AND LORD CONNISTON BOTH TOLD ALICE THAT BERNARD WAS INNOCENT
8747-293952-0053.flac,THEY WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO PROVE THAT SNEERED BERYL WITH A WHITE FACE I BELIEVE THE FELLOW IS ALIVE AFTER ALL
8747-293952-0054.flac,AND THEN ASKED LUCY STARTING UP AND FACING BERYL
8747-293952-0055.flac,AH YOU WOULD MAKE HIM PAY MONEY TO SAVE HIMSELF I HAVE A RIGHT TO A PORTION OF THE ESTATE YOU HAVE NOT SAID MISS RANDOLPH CLENCHING HER FISTS AND ALL HER LANGUOR GONE BERNARD IS THE OWNER OF GORE HALL

8747-293952-0057.flac,HIS NAME WILL BE CLEARED AND THEN YOU WILL THROW ME OVER AND TRY TO BECOME LADY GORE I THROW YOU OVER NOW SAID LUCY LOSING HER TEMPER AND COLORING HOTLY HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME LIKE THIS JULIUS
8747-293952-0058.flac,I WILL NO LONGER BE BOUND TO YOU I NEVER LOVED YOU BUT I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO SEE THE BEST SIDE OF YOU BUT YOU HAVE NO GOOD SIDE YOU ARE A MEAN COWARDLY SERPENT AND IF BERNARD IS ALIVE I SHALL DO MY BEST TO DEFEND HIM
8747-293952-0059.flac,FROM YOUR SNARES BUT LUCY DON'T SPEAK TO ME
8747-293952-0060.flac,I GIVE YOU BACK YOUR RING HERE IT IS SHE WRENCHED IT FROM HER FINGER NOW LEAVE THE HOUSE MISTER BERYL I AM MISTRESS HERE JULIUS LOOKED AT THE RING WHICH SHE HAD THROWN AT HIS FEET AND LAUGHED
8747-293952-0061.flac,YOU TAKE A HIGH TONE HE SAID SNEERINGLY BUT REMEMBER THAT IF BERNARD IS DEAD THE MONEY GOES TO CHARITIES SO MUCH THE BETTER YOU DO NOT GET IT NOR YOU EITHER
8747-293952-0062.flac,YOU WILL HAVE TO TURN OUT OF THIS LUXURIOUS HOME AND LIVE ON THE PITTANCE SIR SIMON LEFT YOU WOULD I BE BETTER OFF IF I MARRIED YOU I THINK YOU WOULD I HAVE NOT MUCH MONEY NOW BUT I WILL HAVE SOME
8747-293952-0063.flac,A GREAT DEAL SOME DAY BY BLACKMAILING BERNARD SAID LUCY INDIGNANTLY JULIUS PICKED UP THE RING AND SLIPPED IT INTO HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET CALMLY WE DON'T KNOW THAT BERNARD IS ALIVE
8747-293952-0064.flac,BUT THE FACT OF CONNISTON LEAVING THE ARMY AND FROM DURHAM'S ATTITUDE I SHREWDLY SUSPECT HE IS AND IN HIDING
8747-293952-0065.flac,AND THEN IT DEPENDS UPON HIM WHETHER HE IS HANGED OR PREFERS TO LIVE ABROAD ON A PORTION OF HIS MONEY THE LESSER PORTION I KNOW THE PRICE OF YOUR SILENCE SAID LUCY VEHEMENTLY YOU WILL WANT THE HALL AND A LARGE INCOME
8747-293952-0066.flac,ALL I CAN GET REJOINED BERYL QUIETLY AND YOU HAVE REFUSED TO SHARE MY FORTUNE WITH ME YES I WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU AND REMEMBER THAT IF I CATCH YOU PLOTTING I WILL TELL MISTER DURHAM

8747-293952-0068.flac,JULIUS SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WALKED TO THE DOOR THERE HE PAUSED TO UTTER A FINAL INSULTING SPEECH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU INTEND TO MARRY BERNARD OR LORD CONNISTON HE SAID BUT I WISH
8747-293952-0069.flac,WHICH EVER IT IS JOY OF A SPITFIRE AND AN HONEST WOMAN SAID MISS RANDOLPH WRATHFULLY FOR THE REFERENCE TO CONNISTON TOUCHED HER NEARLY
8747-293952-0070.flac,BUT YOU GO TOO FAST YOU CAN'T YET PROVE THAT BERNARD LIVES I GO TO DO SO SNEERED JULIUS AND BOWED HIMSELF IRONICALLY OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING LUCY FURIOUS BOTH WITH HIM AND WITH HERSELF
8747-293952-0071.flac,SHE WAS ANGRY WITH HERSELF BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT IN SPEAKING OF CONNISTON SHE HAD COLORED AND AS A MATTER OF FACT SHE GREATLY ADMIRED THE YOUNG LORD EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD ONLY MET ONCE
8747-293952-0072.flac,FOR CONNISTON WAS ONE OF THOSE IRRESISTIBLE MEN WHO APPEAL TO WOMEN LUCY THOUGHT BUT IT MATTERS LITTLE WHAT SHE THOUGHT ALL SHE KNEW WAS THAT HER ENGAGEMENT TO JULIUS WHICH HAD ALWAYS WEIGHED ON HER CONSCIENCE WAS AT AN END
8747-293952-0073.flac,I AM FREE NOW FREE SHE SAID STRETCHING HER HANDS OH WHAT AN ESCAPE I HAVE HAD FROM THAT WICKED MAN HE HAS SHOWN HIS HAND TOO PLAINLY I WILL PUT MISTER DURHAM ON HIS GUARD AND
8747-293952-0074.flac,HERE SHE BLUSHED AND LORD CONNISTON JULIUS WALKING TOWARDS THE BOWER WAS ALSO ANGRY WITH HIMSELF AS LUCY THOUGHT HE HAD SHOWN HIS HAND TOO CLEARLY
8747-293952-0075.flac,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER HE CONSIDERED TO HAVE HELD MY TONGUE I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD SHE NOT GOADED ME INTO SPEECH SHE WILL TELL DURHAM AND THAT INTERFERING CONNISTON AND PUT THEM ON THEIR GUARD WELL
8747-293952-0076.flac,HE LAUGHED AND LOOKED AT THE SMALL BOY TROTTING BESIDE HIM I AM EQUAL TO BOTH THE BOY WAS A HANDSOME INNOCENT LOOKING LITTLE FELLOW RATHER UNDERSIZED
8747-293952-0077.flac,WITH HIS CLEAR SKIN HIS FAIR HAIR AND WIDE BLUE EYES HE LOOKED LIKE THE CONVENTIONAL PICTURE OF A CHERUB
8747-293952-0078.flac,BUT HIS MIND HAD NOT YET HAD TIME TO WORK ON HIS FACE AND THE MASK OF HIS CHILDHOOD FOR HE WAS ONLY THIRTEEN CONCEALED HIS EVIL NATURE SUCCESSFULLY IN A FEW YEARS WHEN HIS PASSIONS WORKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE MASK HIS FACE
8747-293952-0079.flac,WOULD BE WRINKLED AND SINFUL HIS MIND WOULD HAVE MARKED PLAINLY ITS SIGNET ON THE SMOOTH SURFACE BUT AT PRESENT HE LOOKED CHARMINGLY INNOCENT ALTHOUGH HE ALREADY KNEW MUCH MORE ABOUT LIFE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HIM
8747-293952-0080.flac,JULIUS IN ORDER THAT THE LAD MIGHT MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON MISS PLANTAGENET HAD DRESSED HIM IN A NEW SUIT AND PLEASED WITH HIMSELF FOR MUCH OF THE BOY REMAINED IN THIS PRECOCIOUS CRIMINAL YOUNG JERRY TROTTED ALONG SMILING
8747-293952-0081.flac,JERRY SAID BERYL LOOKING DOWN MIND YOU ARE NICE TO THE OLD LADY JERRY TOSSED HIS FAIR CURLS AND LOOKED ROGUISH OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT MISTER BERYL ALL OLD LADIES TAKE TO ME
8747-293952-0082.flac,THEY THINK I'M A KIND OF HOLY BILL AND I LET THEM THINK SO IT PAYS JERRY YOU ARE A YOUNG SCAMP OF THE WORST THE BOY CHUCKLED AS THOUGH HE HAD RECEIVED A COMPLIMENT I LIKE DOING THINGS HE EXPLAINED FRANKLY IT'S FUN
8747-293952-0083.flac,IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR VICTORIA
8747-293952-0084.flac,YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT SUCH THINGS CORRECTED THE RESPECTABLE MISTER BERYL SEVERELY I KNOW A JOLLY SIGHT MORE THAN YOU THINK SAID THE URCHIN UNDER HIS BREATH AND PRODUCING A CIGARETTE JULIUS TOOK IT FROM HIM
8747-293952-0085.flac,AND DULL SAID JERRY PUTTING HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LORD WHAT A BORE STOPPING WITH HER WILL BE BUT I CAN NIP OVER AND SEE VICTORIA WHEN I LIKE AND KEEP AN EYE ON LORD CONNISTON AS I TOLD YOU
8747-293952-0086.flac,I'M FLY SAID MASTER MOON AND BEGAN WHISTLING JULIUS LOOKED AT HIM WITH SATISFACTION HE INTENDED THAT THE BOY SHOULD REMAIN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SO AS TO KEEP WATCH ON CONNISTON
8747-293952-0087.flac,ON DURHAM AND ON ALICE MALLESON FOR THIS LAST REASON HE WAS INTRODUCING HIM INTO THE HOUSE IF BERNARD WERE ALIVE AS JULIUS BEGAN TO SUSPECT HE WOULD COME TO ONE OF THESE THREE PEOPLE AND THEN JERRY WOULD AT ONCE BECOME AWARE OF THE FACT
8747-293952-0088.flac,MISS BERENGARIA WAS AS USUAL IN THE GARDEN LOOKING AFTER THE WELL BEING OF SOME WHITE CHRYSANTHEMUMS SHE RAISED HER HEAD WHEN SHE SAW HER VISITORS AND A LOOK OF ANNOYANCE CROSSED HER FACE WHEN SHE SAW MISTER BERYL
8747-293952-0089.flac,AND BUT FOR THE SAKE OF ALICE SHE WOULD HAVE REFUSED TO LET HIM ENTER THE BOWER AS IT WAS AND WITH GREAT DIPLOMACY SO GREAT THAT IT DECEIVED EVEN THE ASTUTE BERYL SHE ASKED HIM TO COME INTO THE HOUSE
8747-293952-0090.flac,LUCKILY ALICE WAS OUT OF THE WAY HAVING GONE TO PAY A VISIT BUT SHE WAS EXPECTED BACK MOMENTARILY AND MISS BERENGARIA WISHED TO GET RID OF JULIUS BEFORE THE GIRL RETURNED SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONCEAL HER REAL FEELINGS BUT
8747-293952-0091.flac,ALICE BEING SO YOUNG AND IMPULSIVE MIGHT SHOW HER DISLIKE TOO PLAINLY AND PUT BERYL ON HIS GUARD WHO IS THIS YOU HAVE HERE ASKED MISS PLANTAGENET PUTTING ON HER SPECTACLES AND SURVEYING JERRY WITH ADMIRATION WHAT A PRETTY LAD
8747-293952-0092.flac,HE IS A LAD I WISH YOU TO HELP SAID BERYL BLANDLY LAST TIME WE MET MISS PLANTAGENET YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WANTED A PAGE NOT EXACTLY A PAGE SAID THE OLD DAME RUBBING HER NOSE

8747-293952-0100.flac,AT YOUR REQUEST SAID JULIUS LOOKING AT HER DIRECTLY FOREARMED AS SHE WAS MISS BERENGARIA WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BERNARD'S SECRET FLUSHED THROUGH HER WITHERED SKIN
8747-293952-0101.flac,BUT TURNED THE CONVERSATION DEFIANTLY

8747-293952-0109.flac,THEN HE TOOK HIS LEAVE AND THE OLD LADY WATCHED HIM GO
8580-287363-0000.flac,RAPIDLY THE AIRSHIP ASCENDED AND WHEN IT WAS HIGH OVER THE TOWN OF SHOPTON TOM HEADED THE CRAFT DUE WEST LOOKING DOWN HE TRIED TO DESCRY MARY NESTOR IN HER CARRIAGE BUT THE TREES WERE IN THE WAY
8580-287363-0001.flac,THEIR INTERLOCKING BRANCHES HIDING THE GIRL TOM DID SEE CROWDS OF OTHER PERSONS THOUGH THRONGING THE STREETS OF SHOPTON FOR THOUGH THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD MADE MANY FLIGHTS THERE WAS ALWAYS A NOVELTY ABOUT THEM THAT BROUGHT OUT THE CURIOUS
8580-287363-0002.flac,COMPLIMENTED MISTER PARKER IS IT ALWAYS AS EASY AS THIS STARTING ALWAYS IS WAS THE ANSWER THOUGH AS THE IRISHMAN SAID COMING DOWN ISN'T SOMETIMES QUITE SO COMFORTABLE BLESS MY GIZZARD THAT'S SO
8580-287363-0003.flac,CRIED THE ECCENTRIC MISTER DAMON CAN WE VOL PLANE TO EARTH IN THE RED CLOUD TOM YES BUT NOT AS EASILY AS IN THE BUTTERFLY HOWEVER I HOPE WE WILL NOT HAVE TO
8580-287363-0004.flac,NOW MISTER DAMON IF YOU WILL JUST TAKE CHARGE OF THE STEERING APPARATUS FOR A MINUTE I WANT TO GO AFT WHAT FOR I WISH TO SEE IF EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY ERADICATE WAS MAKING THOSE QUEER MOTIONS
8580-287363-0005.flac,MISTER DAMON WHO KNEW HOW TO OPERATE THE RED CLOUD WAS SOON GUIDING HER ON THE COURSE WHILE TOM MADE HIS WAY TO THE REAR COMPARTMENTS THROUGH THE MOTOR ROOM WHERE THE STORES OF SUPPLIES AND FOOD WERE KEPT HE MADE A CAREFUL EXAMINATION
8580-287363-0006.flac,LOOKING FROM AN AFTER WINDOW AND EVEN GOING OUT ON A SMALL OPEN PLATFORM BUT COULD DISCOVER NOTHING WRONG I GUESS RAD WAS JUST CAPERING ABOUT WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL OBJECT MUSED TOM
8580-287363-0007.flac,THAT THE COLORED MAN HAD HAD A METHOD IN HIS MADNESS ON HIS WAY BACK THROUGH THE MOTOR ROOM TOM LOOKED TO THE MACHINERY AND ADJUSTED SOME OF THE AUXILIARY OIL FEEDERS THE VARIOUS PIECES OF APPARATUS WERE WORKING WELL
8580-287363-0008.flac,THOUGH THE ENGINE HAD NOT YET BEEN SPEEDED UP TO ITS LIMIT TOM WANTED IT TO WARM UP FIRST EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT ASKED MISTER DAMON AS TOM REJOINED THEM IN THE PILOT HOUSE WHICH WAS JUST FORWARD OF THE LIVING ROOM IN THE MAIN CABIN
8580-287363-0009.flac,YES I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT MADE RAD ACT THAT WAY BUT I'LL SET THE AUTOMATIC STEERING GEAR NOW MISTER DAMON AND THEN YOU WILL BE RELIEVED MISTER JENKS WAS GAZING OFF TOWARD THE WEST
8580-287363-0010.flac,TO WHERE HE HOPED TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN HOW DO YOU LIKE IT ASKED TOM IT'S GREAT REPLIED THE DIAMOND MAN I'VE NEVER BEEN IN AN AIRSHIP BEFORE AND IT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I EXPECTED BUT IT'S GREAT
8580-287363-0011.flac,IT'S THE ONLY CRAFT THAT WILL SERVE OUR PURPOSE AMONG THE TOWERING MOUNTAIN PEAKS WHERE THE DIAMOND MAKERS ARE HIDDEN I HOPE WE CAN FIND THEM IN A LITTLE WHILE THE RED CLOUD WAS SKIMMING ALONG AT FASTER SPEED
8580-287363-0012.flac,GUIDED BY THE AUTOMATIC RUDDERS SO THAT NO ONE WAS NEEDED IN THE PILOT HOUSE SINCE THERE WAS NO DANGER OF COLLISIONS AIRSHIPS ARE NOT QUITE NUMEROUS ENOUGH FOR THAT YET THOUGH THEY MAY SOON BECOME SO
8580-287363-0013.flac,TOM AND THE OTHERS DEVOTED SEVERAL HOURS TO ARRANGING THEIR STATEROOMS AND BUNKS AND GETTING THEIR CLOTHING STOWED AWAY AND WHEN THIS WAS DONE MISTER PARKER AND MISTER JENKS SAT GAZING OFF INTO SPACE IT'S HARD TO REALIZE THAT WE ARE REALLY IN AN AIRSHIP
8580-287363-0014.flac,OBSERVED THE DIAMOND MAN AT FIRST I THOUGHT I WOULD BE FRIGHTENED BUT I'M NOT A BIT IT DOESN'T SEEM AS IF ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN SOMETHING IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN SOON SAID MISTER PARKER SUDDENLY
8580-287363-0015.flac,AS HE GAZED AT SOME WEATHER INSTRUMENTS ON THE CABIN WALL BLESS MY SOUL DON'T SAY THAT CRIED MISTER DAMON WHAT IS IT I THINK FROM MY OBSERVATIONS THAT WE WILL SOON HAVE A HURRICANE SAID THE SCIENTIFIC MAN
8580-287363-0016.flac,THERE IS EVERY INDICATION OF IT AND HE SEEMED QUITE DELIGHTED AT THE PROSPECT OF HIS PREDICTION COMING TRUE A HURRICANE CRIED MISTER DAMON I HOPE IT ISN'T LIKE THE ONE THAT BLEW US TO EARTHQUAKE ISLAND
8580-287363-0017.flac,OH I THINK THERE WILL BE NO DANGER SPOKE TOM IF IT COMES ON TO BLOW WE WILL ASCEND OR DESCEND OUT OF THE PATH OF THE STORM THIS CRAFT IS NOT LIKE THE ILL FATED WHIZZER I CAN MORE EASILY HANDLE THE RED CLOUD EVEN IN A BAD STORM
8580-287363-0018.flac,REMARKED MISTER JENKS IT WOULD BE TOO BAD TO BE WRECKED BEFORE WE GOT TO PHANTOM MOUNTAIN WELL I PREDICT THAT WE WILL HAVE A BAD STORM INSISTED MISTER PARKER
8580-287363-0019.flac,AND TOM COULD NOT HELP WISHING THAT THE SCIENTIST WOULD KEEP HIS GLOOMY FOREBODINGS TO HIMSELF HOWEVER THE STORM HAD NOT DEVELOPED UP TO NOON WHEN TOM WITH MISTER DAMON'S HELP SERVED A FINE MEAL IN THE DINING ROOM IN THE AFTERNOON THE SPEED OF THE SHIP WAS INCREASED
8580-287363-0020.flac,AND BY NIGHT THEY HAD COVERED SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES THROUGH THE DARKNESS THE RED CLOUD KEPT ON MAKING GOOD TIME TOM GOT UP OCCASIONALLY TO LOOK TO THE MACHINERY
8580-287363-0021.flac,AND AN ALARM BELL WOULD SOUND IN HIS STATEROOM WHEN ANYTHING WENT WRONG BLESS MY NAPKIN EXCLAIMED MISTER DAMON THE NEXT MORNING AS THEY SAT DOWN TO A BREAKFAST OF FRUIT HAM AND EGGS AND FRAGRANT COFFEE
8580-287363-0022.flac,AND YET WE ARE HOW FAR ARE WE ABOVE THE EARTH TOM HE ASKED TURNING TO THE YOUNG INVENTOR ABOUT TWO MILES NOW I JUST SENT HER UP AS I THOUGHT I DETECTED THAT STORM MISTER PARKER SPOKE OF I TOLD YOU IT WOULD COME DECLARED THE SCIENTIST
8580-287363-0023.flac,THAT MORNING BUT ONLY THE LOWER EDGE OF IT CAUGHT THE RED CLOUD AND WHEN TOM SENT HER UP STILL HIGHER SHE FOUND A COMPARATIVELY QUIET ZONE WHERE SHE SLID ALONG AT GOOD SPEED
8580-287363-0024.flac,THAT AFTERNOON TOM BUSIED HIMSELF ABOUT SOME WIRES AND A NUMBER OF COMPLICATED PIECES OF APPARATUS WHICH WERE IN ONE CORNER OF THE MAIN CABIN WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW ASKED MISTER JENKS WHO HAD BEEN TALKING WITH MISTER PARKER
8580-287363-0025.flac,AND SHOWING THAT SCIENTIST SOME OF THE MANUFACTURED DIAMONDS GETTING OUR WIRELESS APPARATUS IN SHAPE ANSWERED THE LAD I SHOULD HAVE DONE IT BEFORE BUT I HAD SO MUCH TO DO THAT I COULDN'T GET AT IT
8580-287363-0026.flac,DAD WILL WANT TO KNOW HOW WE ARE DOING AS HE WORKED AWAY HE ALSO MADE UP HIS MIND TO SEND ANOTHER MESSAGE IN CARE OF HIS FATHER FOR THERE WAS A RECEIVING STATION IN THE SWIFT HOME AND TO WHOM THIS MESSAGE WAS ADDRESSED TOM DID NOT SAY
8580-287363-0027.flac,BUT WE FANCY SOME OF OUR READERS CAN GUESS FINALLY AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF WORK THE WIRELESS WAS IN SHAPE TO SEND AND RECEIVE MESSAGES TOM PULLED OVER THE LEVER AND A CRACKLING SOUND WAS HEARD
8580-287363-0028.flac,AS THE ELECTRICITY LEAPED FROM THE TRANSMITTERS INTO SPACE THEN HE CLAMPED THE RECEIVER ON HIS EAR ALL READY HE ANNOUNCED HAS ANYBODY ANY MESSAGES THEY WISH SENT FOR WITH THE COURTESY OF A TRUE HOST
8580-287363-0029.flac,HE WAS READY TO SERVE HIS GUESTS BEFORE HE FORWARDED HIS OWN WIRELESS NOTES JUST TELL MY WIFE THAT I'M ENJOYING MYSELF REQUESTED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY FOOTSTOOL BUT THIS IS GREAT WE'RE OFF THE EARTH YET
8580-287363-0030.flac,CONNECTED WITH IT MISTER JENKS HAD NO ONE TO WHOM HE WANTED TO SEND ANY WORD BUT MISTER PARKER WISH TO WIRE TO A FELLOW SCIENTIST THE RESULT OF SOME OBSERVATIONS MADE IN THE UPPER AIR TOM NOTED ALL THE MESSAGES DOWN
8580-287363-0031.flac,AND THEN WHEN ALL WAS IN READINESS HE BEGAN TO CALL HIS HOME STATION HE KNEW THAT EITHER HIS FATHER OR MISTER JACKSON THE ENGINEER COULD RECEIVE THE WIRELESS
8580-287363-0032.flac,BUT NO SOONER HAD THE YOUNG INVENTOR SENT OFF THE FIRST FEW DOTS AND DASHES REPRESENTING S I HIS HOME STATION CALL THAN HE STARTED AND A LOOK OF SURPRISE CAME OVER HIS FACE THEY'RE CALLING US HE EXCLAIMED WHO IS
8580-287363-0033.flac,ASKED MISTER JENKS MY HOUSE MY FATHER HE HE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET US EVER SINCE WE STARTED BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THE WIRELESS IN SHAPE TO RECEIVE MESSAGES OH I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO LATE TOO LATE BLESS MY SOUL TOO LATE FOR WHAT
8580-287363-0034.flac,GASPED MISTER DAMON SOMEWHAT ALARMED BY TOM'S MANNER THE LAD DID NOT ANSWER AT ONCE HE WAS INTENTLY LISTENING TO A SERIES OF DOTS AND DASHES THAT CLICKED IN THE TELEPHONE RECEIVER CLAMPED TO HIS LEFT EAR ON HIS FACE
8580-287363-0035.flac,THERE WAS A LOOK OF WORRIMENT FATHER HAS JUST SENT ME A MESSAGE HE SAID IT'S A WARNING FLASHED THROUGH SPACE HE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET IT TO ME SINCE YESTERDAY
8580-287363-0036.flac,ASKED MISTER JENKS RISING FROM HIS SEAT THE MYSTERIOUS MAN IS ABOARD THE AIRSHIP HIDDEN AWAY CRIED TOM THAT'S WHAT ERADICATE WAS TRYING TO CALL TO OUR ATTENTION AS WE STARTED OFF
8580-287364-0000.flac,CHAPTER TEN DROPPING THE STOWAWAY TOM'S EXCITED ANNOUNCEMENT STARTLED MISTER DAMON AND THE OTHERS AS MUCH AS IF THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD INFORMED THEM THAT THE AIRSHIP HAD EXPLODED
8580-287364-0001.flac,AND WAS ABOUT TO DASH WITH THEM TO THE EARTH THE MEN LEAPED TO THEIR FEET AND STARED AT THE LAD A STOWAWAY ON BOARD CRIED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY SOUL HOW DID HE ARE YOU SURE THAT MESSAGE IS STRAIGHT ASKED MISTER JENKS
8580-287364-0002.flac,DID ERADICATE SEE THE MAN HE SAYS HE DID ANSWERED TOM THE MAN IS HIDDEN AWAY ON BOARD NOW PROBABLY AMONG THE STORES AND SUPPLIES BLESS MY TOMATO SAUCE EXPLODED MISTER DAMON
8580-287364-0003.flac,WE MUST GET HIM OUT AT ONCE DECLARED MISTER JENKS I KNEW SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN ON THIS VOYAGE CAME FROM MISTER PARKER I PREDICTED IT FROM THE FIRST TOM THOUGHT CONSIDERABLE
8580-287364-0004.flac,BUT HE DID NOT ANSWER THE SCIENTIST JUST THEN ANOTHER COMMUNICATION WAS COMING TO HIM BY WIRELESS HE LISTENED INTENTLY FATHER SAYS THE LAD TOLD HIS COMPANIONS THAT ERADICATE ONLY HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE MAN AT THE LAST MOMENT
8580-287364-0005.flac,HE WAS LOOKING FROM THE REAR STOREROOM WINDOW HE'S THE SAME MAN WHO CALLED ON ME THAT TIME RAD REMEMBERS HIM VERY WELL BLESS MY SHOES WHAT'S TO BE DONE INQUIRED MISTER DAMON LOOKING AROUND HELPLESSLY
8580-287364-0006.flac,DECIDED MISTER JENKS WITH VIGOR GET HIM OUT AND DROP HIM OVERBOARD DROP HIM OVERBOARD CRIED MISTER PARKER IN HORROR NOT EXACTLY BUT GET RID OF HIM
8580-287364-0007.flac,THAT MAN IS ONE OF MY ENEMIES HE HAS BEEN SENT BY THE BAND OF DIAMOND MAKERS HIDDEN AMONG THE MOUNTAINS TO SPY ON ME AND IF POSSIBLE PREVENT ME FROM SEEKING TO DISCOVER THEIR SECRET
8580-287364-0008.flac,HE TRIED TO WORK ON TOM'S SWIFT'S FEARS AND FRIGHTEN HIM FROM USING HIS AIRSHIP ON THIS QUEST THEN WHEN HE FAILED THE MAN MUST HAVE SNEAKED INTO THE SHED AND HIDDEN HIMSELF IN THE SHIP WE MUST GET RID OF HIM OR HE MAY WRECK THE RED CLOUD
8580-287364-0009.flac,THAT'S SO CRIED TOM WE MUST TRY TO CAPTURE HIM I THINK WE HAD BETTER THE LAD PAUSED AND AGAIN LISTENED TO THE WIRELESS MESSAGE FATHER SAYS ERADICATE SAW THE MAN HAVE A GUN SO WE MUST BE CAREFUL
8580-287364-0010.flac,THE YOUNG INVENTOR TRANSLATED THE DOTS AND DASHES BLESS MY POWDER HORN EXPLODED MISTER DAMON WE SHALL HAVE TO PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY THEN SPOKE MISTER JENKS
8580-287364-0011.flac,IF HE IS LIKE ANY OTHERS IN THE GANG HE IS A DESPERATE MAN BETTER SNEAK UP ON HIM THEN IF WE CAN PROPOSED MISTER PARKER THERE ARE ENOUGH OF US TO COPE WITH ONE MAN EVEN IF HE IS ARMED
8580-287364-0012.flac,HE INQUIRED OF TOM YES WAS THE HESITATING ANSWER BUT I DON'T WANT TO USE THEM IF I CAN HELP IT NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE DANGER AND A DISLIKE OF SHEDDING BLOOD BUT
8580-287364-0013.flac,BECAUSE A STRAY BULLET MIGHT PIERCE THE GAS BAG AND DAMAGE THE SHIP THAT'S SO AGREED MISTER JENKS WELL I GUESS IF WE GO AT IT THE RIGHT WAY WE CAN CAPTURE HIM WITHOUT ANY SHOOTING BUT WE MUST TALK MORE QUIETLY
8580-287364-0014.flac,HE MAY HAVE HEARD US I DON'T THINK SO REPLIED TOM THE STOREROOM IS FAR ENOUGH OFF SO THAT HE COULDN'T HEAR US BESIDES THE MOTOR MAKES SUCH A RACKET THAT HE COULDN'T DISTINGUISH WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EVEN IF HE HEARD OUR VOICES
8580-287364-0015.flac,SO UNLESS HE HEARD THE WIRELESS WORKING AND SUSPECTS SOMETHING FROM THAT HE PROBABLY DOESN'T KNOW THAT WE ARE AWARE OF HIS PRESENCE ABOARD BUT WHY DO YOU THINK HE HAS REMAINED QUIET ALL THIS WHILE TOM ASKED MISTER DAMON
8580-287364-0016.flac,PROBABLY HE WANTS TO WAIT UNTIL THE SHIP IS FARTHER OUT WEST SUGGESTED MISTER JENKS THEN HE WILL BE NEARER HIS FRIENDS AND CAN GET HELP IF HE NEEDS IT AND DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE HE WOULD DESTROY THE RED CLOUD ASKED MISTER PARKER
8580-287364-0017.flac,I THINK THAT ALL HE IS WAITING FOR IS A FAVORABLE CHANCE DECLARED THE DIAMOND SEEKER HE WOULD DESTROY THE CRAFT AND US TOO IF HE COULD PREVENT US FROM DISCOVERING THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN I BELIEVE
8580-287364-0018.flac,THEN WE MUST GET AHEAD OF HIM DECIDED TOM QUIETLY I HAVE JUST FLASHED TO DAD A MESSAGE TELLING HIM THAT WE WILL HEED HIS WARNING NOW TO CAPTURE THE STOWAWAY
8580-287364-0019.flac,AND WHILE WE'RE ABOUT IT GIVE HIM A GOOD SCARE WHEN WE DO GET HIM SUGGESTED MISTER JENKS HOW ASKED TOM THREATEN TO DROP HIM OVERBOARD PERHAPS THAT WILL MAKE HIM TELL HOW HE HAPPENED TO GET IN OUR SHIP
8580-287364-0020.flac,AND WHAT ARE THE PLANS OF THE GANG OF DIAMOND MAKERS WE MAY GET VALUABLE INFORMATION THAT WAY I DON'T BELIEVE YOU CAN SCARE SUCH FELLOWS MUCH WAS TOM'S OPINION
8580-287364-0021.flac,HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CAPTURE HIM ASKED MISTER PARKER IF HE HAS A GUN IT WON'T BE ANY TOO EASY TO GO IN THE STOREROOM AND DRAG HIM OUT WE'LL HAVE TO USE A LITTLE STRATEGY DECIDED TOM AND THEN THEY DISCUSSED SEVERAL PLANS
8580-287364-0022.flac,THE ONE FINALLY ADOPTED WAS THAT TOM AND MISTER DAMON SHOULD ENTER THE STOREROOM CASUALLY AS IF IN SEARCH OF FOOD TO COOK FOR SUPPER THEY WOULD DISCUSS VARIOUS DISHES AND MISTER DAMON WAS TO EXPRESS A PREFERENCE FOR SOMETHING IN THE FOOD LINE
8580-287364-0023.flac,THE BOX CONTAINING WHICH WAS WELL BACK IN THE ROOM THIS WOULD GIVE THE TWO A CHANCE TO PENETRATE TO THE FAR END OF THE APARTMENT WITHOUT AROUSING THE SUSPICIONS OF THE HIDDEN MAN WHO DOUBTLESS WOULD BE LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION AND AS SOON AS WE GET SIGHT OF HIM
8580-287364-0024.flac,SAID TOM JUMP BEFORE HE HAS A CHANCE TO USE HIS GUN MISTER JENKS AND MISTER PARKER WILL BE WAITING OUTSIDE THE ROOM TO CATCH HIM IF HE GETS AWAY FROM US I'LL HAVE SOME ROPES READY AND WE'LL TIE HIM UP AND WELL WE'LL DECIDE LATER WHAT TO DO WITH HIM ALL RIGHT
8580-287364-0025.flac,I'M READY AS SOON AS YOU ARE TOM SAID THE ECCENTRIC MAN COME AHEAD THEY WENT SOFTLY TO THE STOREROOM AND LISTENED AT THE DOOR THERE WAS NO SOUND HEARD SAVE THAT MADE BY THE MACHINERY I WONDER IF HE'S REALLY HERE
8580-287364-0026.flac,WHISPERED MISTER DAMON WE'LL SOON FIND OUT ANSWERED TOM LET'S GO IN THEY ENTERED AND IN PURSUANCE OF THEIR PLAN TOM AND HIS FRIEND TALKED OF VARIOUS FOODS
8580-287364-0027.flac,I THINK I'D LIKE SOME OF THAT CANNED LOBSTER WITH FRENCH DRESSING ON SPOKE THE ECCENTRIC MAN THAT'S AWAY IN THE BACK END OF THE ROOM SAID TOM IN A LOUD VOICE IT'S UNDER A LOT OF BOXES
8580-287364-0028.flac,THEN I'LL HELP YOU GET IT OUT BLESS MY FRYING PAN BUT I AM VERY FOND OF LOBSTER EXCLAIMED MISTER DAMON IN AS NATURAL TONES AS WAS POSSIBLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
8580-287364-0029.flac,HE AND TOM MOVED CAUTIOUSLY BACK AMONG THE BOXES AND BARRELS THEY WERE GLANCING ABOUT WITH EAGER EYES TOM SWITCHED ON AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND THE INSTANT HE DID SO
8580-287364-0030.flac,HE WAS AWARE OF A MOVEMENT IN A LITTLE SPACE FORMED BY ONE BOX WHICH WAS PLACED ON TOP OF TWO OTHERS THE LAD SAW A DARK FIGURE MOVING AS IF TO GET FARTHER OUT OF SIGHT I'VE GOT HIM CRIED TOM MAKING A DIVE FOR THE SHADOW
8580-287364-0031.flac,A MOMENT LATER THE YOUNG INVENTOR WAS BOWLED OVER AS A DARK FIGURE LEAPED OVER HIS HEAD CATCH HIM MISTER DAMON HE CRIED BLESS MY HATBAND I I MISTER DAMON'S VOICE ENDED IN A GRUNT HE TOO HAD BEEN KNOCKED DOWN BY THE FLEEING MAN
8580-287364-0032.flac,LOOK OUT MISTER JENKS CRIED TOM TO WARN THOSE ON GUARD AT THE DOOR OF THE STOREROOM THERE WAS THE REPORT OF A GUN SOME EXCITED SHOUTS AND WHEN TOM COULD SCRAMBLE TO HIS FEET AND RUSH OUT HE BEHELD MISTER PARKER CALMLY SITTING ON A STRUGGLING MAN
8580-287364-0033.flac,WHILE MISTER JENKS HELD A GUN THAT WAS STILL SMOKING WE CAUGHT HIM CRIED THE SCIENTIST ANYBODY HURT ASKED TOM ANXIOUSLY NO I KNOCKED UP HIS GUN AS HE FIRED EXPLAINED MISTER JENKS WHERE ARE THE ROPES TOM
8580-287364-0034.flac,THE CORDS WERE PRODUCED AND THE MAN WHO HAD NOW CEASED TO STRUGGLE WAS TIGHTLY BOUND HE UTTERED NOT A WORD BUT HE SMILED GRIMLY WHEN MISTER DAMON REMARKED I GUESS I'LL GO BACK IN THE STOREROOM TOM AND SEE HOW MUCH FOOD HE ATE
8580-287364-0035.flac,HE WASN'T THERE LONG ENOUGH WELL FARLEY MUNSON SO IT'S YOU IS IT ASKED MISTER JENKS AS HE SURVEYED THE PRISONER DO YOU KNOW HIM ASKED TOM IN SOME SURPRISE
8580-287364-0036.flac,HE WAS IN WITH THE DIAMOND MAKERS SAID MISTER JENKS HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO TOOK ME TO THE SECRET CAVE BUT IT WILL BE THE LAST TIME HE EVER GOES THERE HOW HIGH UP ARE WE TOM ABOUT TWO MILES WHY
8580-287364-0037.flac,I GUESS THAT WILL BE FAR ENOUGH TO LET HIM FALL WENT ON THE DIAMOND SEEKER COME ON MISTER DAMON HELP ME THROW HIM OVERBOARD YOU
8580-287364-0038.flac,THROW ME OVER WITH THE AIRSHIP TWO MILES HIGH ARE YOU GASPED THE MAN WILL YOU TELL US WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IF WE DON'T ASKED MISTER JENKS
8580-287364-0039.flac,HOW YOU GOT ABOARD AND WHAT YOUR OBJECT WAS IN COMING THAT'S EASY ENOUGH I HAD BEEN HANGING AROUND THE SHED FOR SEVERAL DAYS WATCHING A CHANCE TO GET IN FINALLY I SAW IT WHEN THAT COLORED MAN WENT TO FEED HIS MULE AND I SLIPPED IN AND
8580-287364-0040.flac,HID IN THE AIRSHIP THE STORES WERE ALL IN THEN AND I STOWED MYSELF AWAY AMONG THE BOXES I HAD FOOD AND WATER SO I DIDN'T TOUCH ANY OF YOURS AND HE LOOKED AT MISTER DAMON WHO SEEMED MUCH RELIEVED AND WHAT WAS YOUR OBJECT
8580-287364-0041.flac,DEMANDED MISTER JENKS I WANTED TO PREVENT YOU FROM GOING TO PHANTOM MOUNTAIN HOW BY DESTROYING THE AIRSHIP IF NEED BE BUT I HOPED TO ACCOMPLISH IT BY OTHER MEANS
8580-287364-0042.flac,YOU MUST KEEP AWAY FROM THERE AND IF WE REFUSE ASKED TOM THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE WHAT COMES BUT NOT FROM YOU EXCLAIMED MISTER JENKS WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF YOU
8580-287364-0043.flac,THE MAN'S FACE SHOWED THE ALARM HE FELT OH DON'T WORRY SAID MISTER JENKS QUICKLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO TOSS YOU OVERBOARD
8580-287364-0044.flac,AND THEN GO ON BEFORE YOU CAN SEND ANY WORD TO YOUR CONFEDERATES WE'LL PUT YOU OFF IN THE MOST LONESOME SPOT WE CAN FIND AND I GUESS YOU'LL BE SOME TIME GETTING BACK TO CIVILIZATION BY THAT TIME WE'LL HAVE THE SECRET OF THE DIAMONDS YOU NEVER WILL
8580-287364-0045.flac,DECLARED THE MAN FIRMLY AND HE WOULD SAY NOTHING MORE THOUGH BY THREATS AND PROMISES MISTER JENKS TRIED TO GET FROM HIM SOMETHING ABOUT THE MEN IN WITH HIM AND WHERE THE CAVE OF THE DIAMONDS WAS LOCATED
8580-287364-0046.flac,HEAVILY BOUND WITH ROPES THE MAN WAS LOCKED IN A SMALL CLOSET TO BE KEPT THERE UNTIL A FAVORABLE SPOT WAS REACHED FOR LETTING HIM GO MISTER JENKS PLAN
8580-287364-0047.flac,WAS CONSIDERED A GOOD ONE THREE DAYS LATER IN CROSSING OVER A LONELY REGION NEAR THE NEBRASKA NATIONAL FOREST FARLEY MUNSON WHICH WAS ONE OF THE NAMES THE SPY WENT BY
8580-287364-0048.flac,WAS DROPPED OFF THE AIRSHIP WHEN IT WAS SENT DOWN TO WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE EARTH IT WILL TAKE YOU SOME TIME TO GET TO A TELEGRAPH OFFICE SAID MISTER JENKS AS A PACKAGE OF FOOD AND A FLASK OF WATER WAS TOSSED DOWN TO THE STOWAWAY
8580-287364-0049.flac,HE SHOOK HIS FIST AT THOSE IN THE AIRSHIP AND SHOUTED AFTER THEM YOU'LL NEVER DISCOVER THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN
8095-274346-0000.flac,CHARLES GAVE THEM A GRACIOUS AND A COMPLIANT ANSWER TO ALL THEIR REMONSTRANCES HE WAS HOWEVER IN HIS HEART EXTREMELY AVERSE TO THESE FURIOUS MEASURES
8095-274346-0001.flac,THOUGH A DETERMINED PROTESTANT BY PRINCIPLE AS WELL AS INCLINATION HE HAD ENTERTAINED NO VIOLENT HORROR AGAINST POPERY AND A LITTLE HUMANITY HE THOUGHT WAS DUE BY THE NATION TO THE RELIGION OF THEIR ANCESTORS
8095-274346-0002.flac,AN ABATEMENT OF THE MORE RIGOROUS LAWS WAS ALL HE INTENDED AND HIS ENGAGEMENTS WITH FRANCE NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THEIR REGULAR EXECUTION HAD NEVER BEEN PROMISED OR EXPECTED REQUIRED OF HIM SOME INDULGENCE
8095-274346-0003.flac,BUT SO UNFORTUNATE WAS THIS PRINCE THAT NO MEASURE EMBRACED DURING HIS WHOLE REIGN WAS EVER ATTENDED WITH MORE UNHAPPY AND MORE FATAL CONSEQUENCES
8095-274346-0004.flac,THE EXTREME RAGE AGAINST POPERY WAS A SURE CHARACTERISTIC OF PURITANISM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DISCOVERED OTHER INFALLIBLE SYMPTOMS OF THE PREVALENCE OF THAT PARTY
8095-274346-0005.flac,THEY PETITIONED THE KING FOR REPLACING SUCH ABLE CLERGY AS HAD BEEN SILENCED FOR WANT OF CONFORMITY TO THE CEREMONIES THEY ALSO ENACTED LAWS FOR THE STRICT OBSERVANCE OF SUNDAY WHICH THE PURITANS AFFECTED TO CALL THE SABBATH
8095-274346-0006.flac,AND WHICH THEY SANCTIFIED BY THE MOST MELANCHOLY INDOLENCE IT IS TO BE REMARKED THAT THE DIFFERENT APPELLATIONS OF THIS FESTIVAL WERE AT THAT TIME KNOWN SYMBOLS OF THE DIFFERENT PARTIES
8095-274346-0007.flac,THE KING FINDING THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS RESOLVED TO GRANT HIM NO SUPPLY AND WOULD FURNISH HIM WITH NOTHING BUT EMPTY PROTESTATIONS OF DUTY
8095-274346-0008.flac,WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE COMMAND HE SAILED IMMEDIATELY FOR CADIZ AND FOUND THE BAY FULL OF SPANISH SHIPS OF GREAT VALUE HE EITHER NEGLECTED TO ATTACK THESE SHIPS OR ATTEMPTED IT PREPOSTEROUSLY
8095-274346-0009.flac,THE ARMY WAS LANDED AND A FORT TAKEN BUT THE UNDISCIPLINED SOLDIERS FINDING STORE OF WINE COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED FROM THE UTMOST EXCESSES FURTHER STAY APPEARING FRUITLESS THEY WERE REEMBARKED AND THE FLEET PUT TO SEA
8095-274346-0010.flac,WITH AN INTENTION OF INTERCEPTING THE SPANISH GALLEONS BUT THE PLAGUE HAVING SEIZED THE SEAMEN AND SOLDIERS THEY WERE OBLIGED TO ABANDON ALL HOPES OF THIS PRIZE AND RETURN TO ENGLAND LOUD COMPLAINTS WERE MADE AGAINST THE COURT FOR INTRUSTING SO IMPORTANT A COMMAND
8095-274346-0011.flac,WAS OBLIGED AGAIN TO HAVE RECOURSE TO A PARLIAMENT THOUGH THE ILL SUCCESS OF HIS ENTERPRISES DIMINISHED HIS AUTHORITY AND SHOWED EVERY DAY MORE PLAINLY THE IMPRUDENCE OF THE SPANISH WAR THOUGH THE INCREASE OF HIS NECESSITIES
8095-274346-0012.flac,RENDERED HIM MORE DEPENDENT AND MORE EXPOSED TO THE ENCROACHMENTS OF THE COMMONS HE WAS RESOLVED TO TRY ONCE MORE THAT REGULAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL EXPEDIENT FOR SUPPLY PERHAPS TOO A LITTLE POLITICAL ART WHICH AT THAT TIME HE PRACTISED
8095-274346-0013.flac,WAS MUCH TRUSTED TO HE HAD NAMED FOUR POPULAR LEADERS SHERIFFS OF COUNTIES SIR EDWARD COKE SIR ROBERT PHILIPS SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH AND SIR FRANCIS SEYMOUR AND THOUGH THE QUESTION HAD BEEN FORMERLY MUCH CONTESTED
8095-274346-0014.flac,HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BY THAT MEANS INCAPACITATED THEM FROM BEING ELECTED MEMBERS BUT HIS INTENTION BEING SO EVIDENT RATHER PUT THE COMMONS MORE UPON THEIR GUARD
8095-274346-0015.flac,ENOW OF PATRIOTS STILL REMAINED TO KEEP UP THE ILL HUMOR OF THE HOUSE AND MEN NEEDED BUT LITTLE INSTRUCTION OR RHETORIC TO RECOMMEND TO THEM PRACTICES
8095-274346-0016.flac,THE SUM WAS LITTLE PROPORTIONED TO THE GREATNESS OF THE OCCASION AND ILL FITTED TO PROMOTE THOSE VIEWS OF SUCCESS AND GLORY FOR WHICH THE YOUNG PRINCE IN HIS FIRST ENTERPRISE SO ARDENTLY LONGED BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WAS NOT THE MOST DISAGREEABLE ONE
8095-274346-0017.flac,THE SUPPLY WAS ONLY VOTED BY THE COMMONS THE PASSING OF THAT VOTE INTO A LAW WAS RESERVED TILL THE END OF THE SESSION A CONDITION WAS THEREBY MADE IN A VERY UNDISGUISED MANNER WITH THEIR SOVEREIGN
8095-274346-0018.flac,UNDER COLOR OF REDRESSING GRIEVANCES WHICH DURING THIS SHORT REIGN COULD NOT BE VERY NUMEROUS THEY WERE TO PROCEED IN REGULATING AND CONTROLLING EVERY PART OF GOVERNMENT WHICH DISPLEASED THEM
8095-274346-0019.flac,AND IF THE KING EITHER CUT THEM SHORT IN THIS UNDERTAKING OR REFUSED COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR DEMANDS HE MUST NOT EXPECT ANY SUPPLY FROM THE COMMONS GREAT DISSATISFACTION WAS EXPRESSED BY CHARLES AT A TREATMENT WHICH HE DEEMED SO HARSH AND UNDUTIFUL
8095-274346-0020.flac,BUT HIS URGENT NECESSITIES OBLIGED HIM TO SUBMIT
8095-274346-0021.flac,HAD EXPRESSED ALL DUTY AND OBEDIENCE IN EXPECTATION THAT AN OPPORTUNITY WOULD OFFER OF REINSTATING HIMSELF IN HIS FORMER CREDIT AND AUTHORITY EVEN AFTER CHARLES'S ACCESSION HE DESPAIRED NOT
8095-274346-0022.flac,HE SUBMITTED TO THE KING'S COMMANDS OF REMAINING AT HIS COUNTRY SEAT AND OF ABSENTING HIMSELF FROM PARLIAMENT MANY TRIALS HE MADE TO REGAIN THE GOOD OPINION OF HIS MASTER
8095-274346-0023.flac,BUT FINDING THEM ALL FRUITLESS AND OBSERVING CHARLES TO BE ENTIRELY GOVERNED BY BUCKINGHAM HIS IMPLACABLE ENEMY HE RESOLVED NO LONGER TO KEEP ANY MEASURES WITH THE COURT A NEW SPIRIT HE SAW AND A NEW POWER ARISING IN THE NATION
8095-274346-0024.flac,AND TO THESE HE WAS DETERMINED FOR THE FUTURE TO TRUST FOR HIS SECURITY AND PROTECTION WHEN THE PARLIAMENT WAS SUMMONED CHARLES BY A STRETCH OF PREROGATIVE HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT NO WRIT AS IS CUSTOMARY SHOULD BE SENT TO BRISTOL
8095-274346-0025.flac,THAT NOBLEMAN APPLIED TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS BY PETITION AND CRAVED THEIR GOOD OFFICES WITH THE KING FOR OBTAINING WHAT WAS HIS DUE AS A PEER OF THE REALM HIS WRIT WAS SENT HIM BUT ACCOMPANIED WITH A LETTER FROM THE LORD KEEPER COVENTRY
8095-274346-0026.flac,COMMANDING HIM IN THE KING'S NAME TO ABSENT HIMSELF FROM PARLIAMENT THIS LETTER BRISTOL CONVEYED TO THE LORDS AND ASKED ADVICE HOW TO PROCEED IN SO DELICATE A SITUATION
8095-274346-0027.flac,THE KING'S PROHIBITION WAS WITHDRAWN AND BRISTOL TOOK HIS SEAT PROVOKED AT THESE REPEATED INSTANCES OF VIGOR WHICH THE COURT DENOMINATED CONTUMACY CHARLES ORDERED HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ENTER AN ACCUSATION OF HIGH TREASON AGAINST HIM
8095-274346-0028.flac,BY WAY OF RECRIMINATION BRISTOL ACCUSED BUCKINGHAM OF HIGH TREASON BOTH THE EARL'S DEFENCE OF HIMSELF AND ACCUSATION OF THE DUKE REMAIN AND TOGETHER WITH SOME ORIGINAL LETTERS STILL EXTANT
8095-274346-0029.flac,OF DELIVERING SHIPS TO THE FRENCH KING IN ORDER TO SERVE AGAINST THE HUGONOTS OF BEING EMPLOYED IN THE SALE OF HONORS AND OFFICES OF ACCEPTING EXTENSIVE GRANTS FROM THE CROWN OF PROCURING MANY TITLES OF HONOR FOR HIS KINDRED
8095-274346-0030.flac,AND OF ADMINISTERING PHYSIC TO THE LATE KING WITHOUT ACQUAINTING HIS PHYSICIANS ALL THESE ARTICLES APPEAR FROM COMPARING THE ACCUSATION AND REPLY TO BE EITHER FRIVOLOUS OR FALSE OR BOTH
8095-274346-0031.flac,THE ONLY CHARGE WHICH COULD BE REGARDED AS IMPORTANT WAS THAT HE HAD EXTORTED A SUM OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS FROM THE EAST INDIA COMPANY AND THAT HE HAD CONFISCATED SOME GOODS BELONGING TO FRENCH MERCHANTS ON PRETENCE OF THEIR BEING THE PROPERTY OF SPANISH
8095-274346-0032.flac,SO THAT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO GIVE A DECISIVE OPINION WITH REGARD TO THESE ARTICLES
8095-274346-0033.flac,BUT SO RIVETTED THROUGHOUT THE NATION WERE THE PREJUDICES WITH REGARD TO SPANISH DECEIT AND FALSEHOOD THAT VERY FEW OF THE COMMONS SEEM AS YET TO HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THAT THEY HAD BEEN SEDUCED BY BUCKINGHAM'S NARRATIVE
8095-274346-0034.flac,A CERTAIN PROOF THAT A DISCOVERY OF THIS NATURE WAS NOT AS IS IMAGINED BY SEVERAL HISTORIANS
8095-274346-0035.flac,THE KING SEEMED DESIROUS OF EMBRACING EVERY OPPORTUNITY BY WHICH HE COULD EXPRESS A CONTEMPT AND DISREGARD FOR THEM NO ONE WAS AT THAT TIME SUFFICIENTLY SENSIBLE OF THE GREAT WEIGHT WHICH THE COMMONS BORE IN THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
8095-274346-0036.flac,THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND HAD NEVER HITHERTO AFFORDED ONE INSTANCE WHERE ANY GREAT MOVEMENT OR REVOLUTION HAD PROCEEDED FROM THE LOWER HOUSE AND AS THEIR RANK BOTH CONSIDERED IN A BODY AND AS INDIVIDUALS WAS BUT THE SECOND IN THE KINGDOM
8095-274346-0037.flac,NOTHING LESS THAN FATAL EXPERIENCE COULD ENGAGE THE ENGLISH PRINCES TO PAY A DUE REGARD TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THAT FORMIDABLE ASSEMBLY THE EARL OF SUFFOLK CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE DYING ABOUT THIS TIME
8095-274346-0038.flac,BUCKINGHAM THOUGH LYING UNDER IMPEACHMENT WAS YET BY MEANS OF COURT INTEREST CHOSEN IN HIS PLACE THE COMMONS RESENTED AND LOUDLY COMPLAINED OF THIS AFFRONT AND THE MORE TO ENRAGE THEM THE KING HIMSELF WROTE A LETTER TO THE UNIVERSITY EXTOLLING THE DUKE
8095-274346-0039.flac,YET LEST ANY AMBIGUITY SHOULD REMAIN SIR DUDLEY CARLETON VICE CHAMBERLAIN TOOK CARE TO EXPLAIN IT I PRAY YOU CONSIDER SAID HE WHAT THESE NEW COUNSELS ARE OR MAY BE I FEAR TO DECLARE THOSE THAT I CONCEIVE
8095-274346-0040.flac,IN ALL CHRISTIAN KINGDOMS YOU KNOW THAT PARLIAMENTS WERE IN USE ANCIENTLY BY WHICH THOSE KINGDOMS WERE GOVERNED IN A MOST FLOURISHING MANNER UNTIL THE MONARCHS BEGAN TO KNOW THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND SEEING THE TURBULENT SPIRIT OF THEIR PARLIAMENTS AT LENGTH
8095-274346-0041.flac,THEY BY LITTLE AND LITTLE BEGAN TO STAND ON THEIR PREROGATIVES AND AT LAST OVERTHREW THE PARLIAMENTS THROUGHOUT CHRISTENDOM
8095-274346-0042.flac,WHICH BRINGETH SUCH HAPPINESS TO THIS NATION AND MAKES US ENVIED OF ALL OTHERS WHILE THERE IS THIS SWEETNESS BETWEEN HIS MAJESTY AND THE COMMONS LEST WE LOSE THE REPUTE OF A FREE PEOPLE BY OUR TURBULENCY IN PARLIAMENT
8095-274346-0043.flac,THESE IMPRUDENT SUGGESTIONS RATHER GAVE WARNING THAN STRUCK TERROR A PRECARIOUS LIBERTY THE COMMONS THOUGHT WHICH WAS TO BE PRESERVED BY UNLIMITED COMPLAISANCE WAS NO LIBERTY AT ALL AND IT WAS NECESSARY WHILE YET IN THEIR POWER
8095-274346-0044.flac,TO SECURE THE CONSTITUTION BY SUCH INVINCIBLE BARRIERS THAT NO KING OR MINISTER SHOULD EVER FOR THE FUTURE DARE TO SPEAK SUCH A LANGUAGE TO ANY PARLIAMENT OR EVEN ENTERTAIN SUCH A PROJECT AGAINST THEM
8095-274346-0045.flac,THE COMMONS IMMEDIATELY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD PROCEED NO FURTHER UPON BUSINESS TILL THEY HAD SATISFACTION IN THEIR PRIVILEGES CHARLES ALLEGED AS THE REASON OF THIS MEASURE CERTAIN SEDITIOUS EXPRESSIONS WHICH HE SAID HAD IN THEIR ACCUSATION OF THE DUKE
8095-274346-0046.flac,DROPPED FROM THESE MEMBERS UPON INQUIRY IT APPEARED THAT NO SUCH EXPRESSIONS HAD BEEN USED THE MEMBERS WERE RELEASED AND THE KING REAPED NO OTHER BENEFIT FROM THIS ATTEMPT THAN TO EXASPERATE THE HOUSE STILL
8095-274346-0047.flac,AND TO SHOW SOME DEGREE OF PRECIPITANCY AND INDISCRETION MOVED BY THIS EXAMPLE THE HOUSE OF PEERS WERE ROUSED FROM THEIR INACTIVITY AND CLAIMED LIBERTY FOR THE EARL OF ARUNDEL WHO HAD BEEN LATELY CONFINED IN THE TOWER
8095-274346-0048.flac,AFTER MANY FRUITLESS EVASIONS THE KING
8095-274346-0049.flac,HIS MOTHER WHO HAD GREAT INFLUENCE OVER HIM WAS A PROFESSED CATHOLIC HIS WIFE WAS NOT FREE FROM SUSPICION
8095-274346-0050.flac,SO VIOLENT WAS THE BIGOTRY OF THE TIMES THAT IT WAS THOUGHT A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR DISQUALIFYING ANY ONE FROM HOLDING AN OFFICE
8095-274346-0051.flac,THIS ARTICLE TOGETHER WITH THE NEW IMPOSITIONS LAID ON MERCHANDISE BY JAMES CONSTITUTED NEAR HALF OF THE CROWN REVENUES AND BY DEPRIVING THE KING OF THESE RESOURCES THEY WOULD HAVE REDUCED HIM TO TOTAL SUBJECTION AND DEPENDENCE
8095-274346-0052.flac,WHILE THEY RETAINED SUCH A PLEDGE BESIDES THE SUPPLY ALREADY PROMISED THEY WERE SURE THAT NOTHING COULD BE REFUSED THEM THOUGH AFTER CANVASSING THE MATTER NEAR THREE NINTHS THEY FOUND THEMSELVES UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF FIXING ANY LEGAL CRIME UPON THE DUKE
8095-274346-0053.flac,THE SMALLEST APPEARANCE OF GUILT COULD NOT BE FIXED UPON HIM WHAT IDEA HE ASKED MUST ALL MANKIND ENTERTAIN OF HIS HONOR SHOULD HE SACRIFICE HIS INNOCENT FRIEND TO PECUNIARY CONSIDERATIONS WHAT FURTHER AUTHORITY SHOULD HE RETAIN IN THE NATION
8095-274346-0054.flac,WERE HE CAPABLE IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN TO GIVE IN SO SIGNAL AN INSTANCE SUCH MATTER OF TRIUMPH TO HIS ENEMIES AND DISCOURAGEMENT TO HIS ADHERENTS TO DAY THE COMMONS PRETEND TO WREST HIS MINISTER FROM HIM
8095-274346-0055.flac,TO MORROW THEY WILL ATTACK SOME BRANCH OF HIS PREROGATIVE BY THEIR REMONSTRANCES AND PROMISES AND PROTESTATIONS THEY HAD ENGAGED THE CROWN IN A WAR AS SOON AS THEY SAW A RETREAT IMPOSSIBLE
8095-274346-0056.flac,WITHOUT WAITING FOR NEW INCIDENTS WITHOUT COVERING THEMSELVES WITH NEW PRETENCES THEY IMMEDIATELY DESERTED HIM AND REFUSED HIM ALL REASONABLE SUPPLY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY DESIRED NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO SEE HIM PLUNGED IN INEXTRICABLE DIFFICULTIES
8095-274346-0057.flac,OF WHICH THEY INTENDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE TO SUCH DEEP PERFIDY TO SUCH UNBOUNDED USURPATIONS IT WAS NECESSARY TO OPPOSE A PROPER FIRMNESS AND RESOLUTION
8095-274345-0000.flac,NO SOONER HAD CHARLES TAKEN INTO HIS HANDS THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT THAN HE SHOWED AN IMPATIENCE TO ASSEMBLE THE GREAT COUNCIL OF THE NATION AND HE WOULD GLADLY FOR THE SAKE OF DESPATCH HAVE CALLED TOGETHER THE SAME PARLIAMENT WHICH HAD SITTEN UNDER HIS FATHER
8095-274345-0001.flac,AND WHICH LAY AT THAT TIME UNDER PROROGATION BUT BEING TOLD THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD APPEAR UNUSUAL HE ISSUED WRITS FOR SUMMONING A NEW PARLIAMENT ON THE SEVENTH OF MAY AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REGRET THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRINCESS HENRIETTA
8095-274345-0002.flac,UNEXPERIENCED AND IMPOLITIC REGARDED AS SINCERE ALL THE PRAISES AND CARESSES WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN LOADED WHILE ACTIVE IN PROCURING THE RUPTURE WITH THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA AND BESIDES THAT HE LABORED UNDER GREAT NECESSITIES
8095-274345-0003.flac,HE LIGHTLY MENTIONED THE OCCASION WHICH HE HAD FOR SUPPLY HE EMPLOYED NO INTRIGUE TO INFLUENCE THE SUFFRAGES OF THE MEMBERS HE WOULD NOT EVEN ALLOW THE OFFICERS OF THE CROWN WHO HAD SEATS IN THE HOUSE
8095-274345-0004.flac,AND THAT GREAT ANTICIPATIONS WERE LIKEWISE MADE ON THE REVENUES OF THE CROWN THEY WERE NOT IGNORANT THAT CHARLES WAS LOADED WITH A LARGE DEBT CONTRACTED BY HIS FATHER WHO HAD BORROWED MONEY BOTH FROM HIS OWN SUBJECTS AND FROM FOREIGN PRINCES
8095-274345-0005.flac,THEY HAD LEARNED BY EXPERIENCE THAT THE PUBLIC REVENUE COULD WITH DIFFICULTY MAINTAIN THE DIGNITY OF THE CROWN EVEN UNDER THE ORDINARY CHARGES OF GOVERNMENT
8095-274345-0006.flac,THEY WERE SENSIBLE THAT THE PRESENT WAR WAS VERY LATELY THE RESULT OF THEIR OWN IMPORTUNATE APPLICATIONS AND ENTREATIES AND THAT THEY HAD SOLEMNLY ENGAGED TO SUPPORT THEIR SOVEREIGN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF IT
8095-274345-0007.flac,THEY WERE ACQUAINTED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MILITARY ENTERPRISES DIRECTED AGAINST THE WHOLE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA AGAINST THE KING OF SPAIN POSSESSED OF THE GREATEST RICHES AND MOST EXTENSIVE DOMINIONS OF ANY PRINCE IN EUROPE
8095-274345-0008.flac,AGAINST THE EMPEROR FERDINAND HITHERTO THE MOST FORTUNATE MONARCH OF HIS AGE WHO HAD SUBDUED AND ASTONISHED GERMANY BY THE RAPIDITY OF HIS VICTORIES DEEP IMPRESSIONS THEY SAW MUST BE MADE BY THE ENGLISH SWORD
8095-274345-0009.flac,AND A VIGOROUS OFFENSIVE WAR BE WAGED AGAINST THESE MIGHTY POTENTATES ERE THEY WOULD RESIGN A PRINCIPALITY WHICH THEY HAD NOW FULLY SUBDUED AND WHICH THEY HELD IN SECURE POSSESSION BY ITS BEING SURROUNDED WITH ALL THEIR OTHER TERRITORIES
8095-274345-0010.flac,TO ANSWER THEREFORE ALL THESE GREAT AND IMPORTANT ENDS TO SATISFY THEIR YOUNG KING IN THE FIRST REQUEST WHICH HE MADE THEM TO PROVE THEIR SENSE OF THE MANY ROYAL VIRTUES PARTICULARLY ECONOMY WITH WHICH CHARLES WAS ENDUED
8095-274345-0011.flac,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CONDUCTED BY THE WISEST AND ABLEST SENATORS THAT HAD EVER FLOURISHED IN ENGLAND THOUGHT PROPER TO CONFER ON THE KING A SUPPLY OF TWO SUBSIDIES
8095-274345-0012.flac,WHICH THE PRESENT CONJUNCTURE COULD SUGGEST TO THEM IT IS NOT TO BE DOUBTED BUT SPLEEN AND ILL WILL AGAINST THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM HAD AN INFLUENCE WITH MANY SO VAST AND RAPID A FORTUNE SO LITTLE MERITED
8095-274345-0013.flac,COULD NOT FAIL TO EXCITE PUBLIC ENVY AND HOWEVER MEN'S HATRED MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED FOR A MOMENT WHILE THE DUKE'S CONDUCT SEEMED TO GRATIFY THEIR PASSIONS AND THEIR PREJUDICES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM LONG TO PRESERVE THE AFFECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE
8095-274345-0014.flac,HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE MODESTY OF CHARLES EXCEEDED EVEN THAT WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED OVER THE WEAKNESS OF JAMES NOR WAS ANY PUBLIC MEASURE CONDUCTED BUT BY HIS COUNSEL AND DIRECTION
8095-274345-0015.flac,HIS VEHEMENT TEMPER PROMPTED HIM TO RAISE SUDDENLY TO THE HIGHEST ELEVATION HIS FLATTERERS AND DEPENDANTS AND UPON THE LEAST OCCASION OF DISPLEASURE HE THREW THEM DOWN WITH EQUAL IMPETUOSITY AND VIOLENCE IMPLACABLE IN HIS HATRED
8095-274345-0016.flac,FICKLE IN HIS FRIENDSHIPS ALL MEN WERE EITHER REGARDED AS HIS ENEMIES OR DREADED SOON TO BECOME SUCH THE WHOLE POWER OF THE KINGDOM WAS GRASPED BY HIS INSATIABLE HAND WHILE HE BOTH ENGROSSED THE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE OF HIS MASTER
8095-274345-0017.flac,AND HELD INVESTED IN HIS SINGLE PERSON THE MOST CONSIDERABLE OFFICES OF THE CROWN HOWEVER THE ILL HUMOR OF THE COMMONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCREASED BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS WE ARE NOT TO SUPPOSE THEM THE SOLE MOTIVES
8095-274345-0018.flac,THE LAST PARLIAMENT OF JAMES AMIDST ALL THEIR JOY AND FESTIVITY HAD GIVEN HIM A SUPPLY VERY DISPROPORTIONED TO HIS DEMAND AND TO THE OCCASION AND AS EVERY HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH WAS ELECTED DURING FORTY YEARS
8095-274345-0019.flac,SUCCEEDED TO ALL THE PASSIONS AND PRINCIPLES OF THEIR PREDECESSORS WE OUGHT RATHER TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS OBSTINACY FROM THE GENERAL SITUATION OF THE KINGDOM DURING THAT WHOLE PERIOD THAN FROM ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ATTENDED THIS PARTICULAR CONJUNCTURE
8095-274345-0020.flac,THE NATION WAS VERY LITTLE ACCUSTOMED AT THAT TIME TO THE BURDEN OF TAXES AND HAD NEVER OPENED THEIR PURSES IN ANY DEGREE FOR SUPPORTING THEIR SOVEREIGN EVEN ELIZABETH NOTWITHSTANDING HER VIGOR AND FRUGALITY
8095-274345-0021.flac,AND THE NECESSARY WARS IN WHICH SHE WAS ENGAGED HAD REASON TO COMPLAIN OF THE COMMONS IN THIS PARTICULAR NOR COULD THE AUTHORITY OF THAT PRINCESS WHICH WAS OTHERWISE ALMOST ABSOLUTE EVER EXTORT FROM THEM THE REQUISITE SUPPLIES
8095-274345-0022.flac,WOULD NOT AUGMENT THEIR NUMBER IN THE SAME PROPORTION THE PURITANICAL PARTY THOUGH DISGUISED HAD A GREAT AUTHORITY OVER THE KINGDOM AND MANY OF THE LEADERS AMONG THE COMMONS HAD SECRETLY EMBRACED THE RIGID TENETS OF THAT SECT
8095-274345-0023.flac,ALL THESE WERE DISGUSTED WITH THE COURT BOTH BY THE PREVALENCE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF CIVIL LIBERTY ESSENTIAL TO THEIR PARTY AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE RESTRAINT UNDER WHICH THEY WERE HELD BY THE ESTABLISHED HIERARCHY
8095-274345-0024.flac,IN ORDER TO FORTIFY HIMSELF AGAINST THE RESENTMENT OF JAMES BUCKINGHAM HAD AFFECTED POPULARITY AND ENTERED INTO THE CABALS OF THE PURITANS BUT BEING SECURE OF THE CONFIDENCE OF CHARLES HE HAD SINCE ABANDONED THIS PARTY
8095-274345-0025.flac,AND ON THAT ACCOUNT WAS THE MORE EXPOSED TO THEIR HATRED AND RESENTMENT THOUGH THE RELIGIOUS SCHEMES OF MANY OF THE PURITANS WHEN EXPLAINED APPEAR PRETTY FRIVOLOUS WE ARE NOT THENCE TO IMAGINE THAT THEY WERE PURSUED BY NONE BUT PERSONS OF WEAK UNDERSTANDINGS
8095-274345-0026.flac,THE MATCH WITH FRANCE AND THE ARTICLES IN FAVOR OF CATHOLICS WHICH WERE SUSPECTED TO BE IN THE TREATY WERE LIKEWISE CAUSES OF DISGUST TO THIS WHOLE PARTY
8095-274345-0027.flac,THOUGH IT MUST BE REMARKED THAT THE CONNECTIONS WITH THAT CROWN WERE MUCH LESS OBNOXIOUS TO THE PROTESTANTS AND LESS AGREEABLE TO THE CATHOLICS THAN THE ALLIANCE FORMERLY PROJECTED WITH SPAIN AND WERE THEREFORE RECEIVED RATHER WITH PLEASURE THAN DISSATISFACTION
8095-274345-0028.flac,AS BY THE HARDSHIPS WHICH SOME OF THEM HAD UNDERGONE IN PROSECUTION OF THEM AMONG THESE WE MAY MENTION THE NAMES OF SIR EDWARD COKE SIR EDWIN SANDYS SIR ROBERT PHILIPS SIR FRANCIS SEYMOUR
8095-274345-0029.flac,SIR DUDLEY DIGGES SIR JOHN ELLIOT SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH MISTER SELDEN AND MISTER PYM ANIMATED WITH A WARM REGARD TO LIBERTY
8095-274345-0030.flac,OF REDUCING THE PREROGATIVE WITHIN MORE REASONABLE COMPASS THOUGH THEIR ANCESTORS HAD BLINDLY GIVEN WAY TO PRACTICES AND PRECEDENTS FAVORABLE TO KINGLY POWER AND HAD BEEN ABLE NOTWITHSTANDING TO PRESERVE SOME SMALL REMAINS OF LIBERTY
8095-274345-0031.flac,IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THEY THOUGHT WHEN ALL THESE PRETENSIONS WERE METHODISED AND PROSECUTED BY THE INCREASING KNOWLEDGE OF THE AGE TO MAINTAIN ANY SHADOW OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SUCH UNLIMITED AUTHORITY IN THE SOVEREIGN
8095-274345-0032.flac,IT WAS NECESSARY TO FIX A CHOICE EITHER TO ABANDON ENTIRELY THE PRIVILEGES OF THE PEOPLE OR TO SECURE THEM BY FIRMER AND MORE PRECISE BARRIERS THAN THE CONSTITUTION HAD HITHERTO PROVIDED FOR THEM IN THIS DILEMMA
8095-274345-0033.flac,MEN OF SUCH ASPIRING GENIUSES AND SUCH INDEPENDENT FORTUNES COULD NOT LONG DELIBERATE THEY BOLDLY EMBRACED THE SIDE OF FREEDOM AND RESOLVED TO GRANT NO SUPPLIES TO THEIR NECESSITOUS PRINCE WITHOUT EXTORTING CONCESSIONS IN FAVOR OF CIVIL LIBERTY
8095-274345-0034.flac,THE END THEY ESTEEMED BENEFICENT AND NOBLE THE MEANS REGULAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL TO GRANT OR REFUSE SUPPLIES WAS THE UNDOUBTED PRIVILEGE OF THE COMMONS AND AS ALL HUMAN GOVERNMENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE OF A MIXED FRAME
8095-274345-0035.flac,ARE IN CONTINUAL FLUCTUATION IT WAS AS NATURAL IN THEIR OPINION AND ALLOWABLE FOR POPULAR ASSEMBLIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAVORABLE INCIDENTS IN ORDER TO SECURE THE SUBJECT
8095-274348-0000.flac,AND WHO FROM A PRIVATE STATION HAD MOUNTED IN THE EARLIEST YOUTH
8095-274348-0001.flac,HE DARED TO CARRY HIS AMBITIOUS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN HERSELF AND HE FAILED NOT TO MAKE IMPRESSION ON A HEART NOT UNDISPOSED TO THE TENDER PASSIONS THAT ATTACHMENT AT LEAST OF THE MIND WHICH APPEARS SO DELICIOUS AND IS SO DANGEROUS
8095-274348-0002.flac,SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE PRINCESS AND THE DUKE PRESUMED SO FAR ON HER GOOD GRACES THAT AFTER HIS DEPARTURE HE SECRETLY RETURNED UPON SOME PRETENCE AND PAYING A VISIT TO THE QUEEN
8095-274348-0003.flac,WAS DISMISSED WITH A REPROOF WHICH SAVORED MORE OF KINDNESS THAN OF ANGER INFORMATION OF THIS CORRESPONDENCE WAS SOON CARRIED TO RICHELIEU THE VIGILANCE OF THAT MINISTER WAS HERE FURTHER ROUSED BY JEALOUSY
8095-274348-0004.flac,HE TOO EITHER FROM VANITY OR POLITICS HAD VENTURED TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN BUT A PRIEST PAST MIDDLE AGE OF A SEVERE CHARACTER AND OCCUPIED IN THE MOST EXTENSIVE PLANS OF AMBITION OR VENGEANCE
8095-274348-0005.flac,ENTIRELY DISPOSED TO GAYETY AND GALLANTRY THE CARDINAL'S DISAPPOINTMENT STRONGLY INCLINED HIM TO COUNTERWORK THE AMOROUS PROJECTS OF HIS RIVAL WHEN THE DUKE WAS MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR A NEW EMBASSY TO PARIS
8095-274348-0006.flac,A MESSAGE WAS SENT HIM FROM LOUIS THAT HE MUST NOT THINK OF SUCH A JOURNEY IN A ROMANTIC PASSION HE SWORE THAT HE WOULD SEE THE QUEEN IN SPITE OF ALL THE POWER OF FRANCE
8095-274348-0007.flac,AND FROM THAT MOMENT HE DETERMINED TO ENGAGE ENGLAND IN A WAR WITH THAT KINGDOM HE FIRST TOOK ADVANTAGE OF SOME QUARRELS EXCITED BY THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND'S ATTENDANTS AND HE PERSUADED CHARLES TO DISMISS AT ONCE ALL HER FRENCH SERVANTS
8095-274348-0008.flac,CONTRARY TO THE ARTICLES OF THE MARRIAGE TREATY HE ENCOURAGED THE ENGLISH SHIPS OF WAR AND PRIVATEERS TO SEIZE VESSELS BELONGING TO FRENCH MERCHANTS
8095-274348-0009.flac,AND STRONGLY SOLICITED CHARLES TO EMBRACE THE PROTECTION OF THESE DISTRESSED RELIGIONISTS HE REPRESENTED THAT AFTER THE INHABITANTS OF ROCHELLE HAD BEEN REPRESSED BY THE COMBINED SQUADRONS OF ENGLAND AND HOLLAND
8095-274348-0010.flac,AFTER PEACE WAS CONCLUDED WITH THE FRENCH KING UNDER CHARLES'S MEDIATION THE AMBITIOUS CARDINAL WAS STILL MEDITATING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HUGONOTS THAT PREPARATIONS WERE SILENTLY MAKING IN EVERY PROVINCE OF FRANCE FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THEIR RELIGION
8095-274348-0011.flac,THAT FORTS WERE ERECTED IN ORDER TO BRIDLE ROCHELLE THE MOST CONSIDERABLE BULWARK OF THE PROTESTANTS THAT THE REFORMED IN FRANCE CAST THEIR EYES ON CHARLES AS THE HEAD OF THEIR FAITH
8095-274348-0012.flac,AND CONSIDERED HIM AS A PRINCE ENGAGED BY INTEREST AS WELL AS INCLINATION TO SUPPORT THEM THAT SO LONG AS THEIR PARTY SUBSISTED CHARLES MIGHT RELY ON THEIR ATTACHMENT AS MUCH AS ON THAT OF HIS OWN SUBJECTS BUT IF THEIR LIBERTIES WERE ONCE RAVISHED FROM THEM
8095-274348-0013.flac,THE POWER OF FRANCE FREED FROM THIS IMPEDIMENT WOULD SOON BECOME FORMIDABLE TO ENGLAND AND TO ALL THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS THOUGH CHARLES PROBABLY BORE BUT SMALL FAVOR TO THE HUGONOTS WHO SO MUCH RESEMBLED THE PURITANS IN DISCIPLINE AND WORSHIP
8095-274348-0014.flac,IN RELIGION AND POLITICS HE YET ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE GAINED BY THESE ARGUMENTS ENFORCED BY THE SOLICITATIONS OF BUCKINGHAM A FLEET OF A HUNDRED SAIL AND AN ARMY OF SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WERE FITTED OUT FOR THE INVASION OF FRANCE
8095-274348-0015.flac,AND BOTH OF THEM INTRUSTED TO THE COMMAND OF THE DUKE WHO WAS ALTOGETHER UNACQUAINTED BOTH WITH LAND AND SEA SERVICE THE FLEET APPEARED BEFORE ROCHELLE BUT SO ILL CONCERTED WERE BUCKINGHAM'S MEASURES THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THAT CITY
8095-274348-0016.flac,SHUT THEIR GATES AND REFUSED TO ADMIT ALLIES OF WHOSE COMING THEY WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY INFORMED
8095-274348-0017.flac,HASTENED THE VENGEANCE OF THEIR MASTER EXHAUSTED THEIR PROVISIONS IN SUPPLYING THEIR ALLIES AND WERE THREATENED WITH AN IMMEDIATE SIEGE
3240-131231-0000.flac,ATTEMPTS TO PRESERVE THE SYSTEM THAT SMALL FROGS AND TOADS FOR INSTANCE NEVER HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY BUT WERE ON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE OR THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SUCH FALLS UP FROM ONE PLACE IN A WHIRLWIND AND DOWN IN ANOTHER
3240-131231-0001.flac,WERE THERE SOME ESPECIALLY FROGGY PLACE NEAR EUROPE AS THERE IS AN ESPECIALLY SANDY PLACE THE SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION WOULD OF COURSE BE THAT ALL SMALL FROGS FALLING FROM THE SKY IN EUROPE COME FROM THAT CENTER OF FROGEITY TO START WITH
3240-131231-0002.flac,I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE SOMETHING THAT I AM PERMITTED TO SEE BECAUSE I AM STILL PRIMITIVE OR INTELLIGENT OR IN A STATE OF MALADJUSTMENT
3240-131231-0003.flac,OF A FALL OF TADPOLES FROM THE SKY AS TO THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
3240-131231-0004.flac,THE WRITER SAYS THAT ALL OBSERVERS WERE MISTAKEN THAT THE FROGS OR TOADS MUST HAVE FALLEN FROM TREES OR OTHER PLACES OVERHEAD TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF LITTLE TOADS ONE OR TWO MONTHS OLD
3240-131231-0005.flac,THAT WERE SEEN TO FALL FROM A GREAT THICK CLOUD THAT APPEARED SUDDENLY IN A SKY THAT HAD BEEN CLOUDLESS AUGUST EIGHTEEN O FOUR NEAR TOULOUSE FRANCE ACCORDING TO A LETTER FROM PROFESSOR PONTUS TO M ARAGO
3240-131231-0006.flac,MANY INSTANCES OF FROGS THAT WERE SEEN TO FALL FROM THE SKY
3240-131231-0007.flac,AS TO HAVING BEEN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
3240-131231-0008.flac,JULY THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0009.flac,LITTLE TOADS FOUND IN A DESERT AFTER A RAINFALL NOTES AND QUERIES
3240-131231-0010.flac,TO START WITH I DO NOT DENY POSITIVELY THE CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATION OF UP AND DOWN I THINK THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SUCH OCCURRENCES I OMIT MANY NOTES THAT I HAVE UPON INDISTINGUISHABLES
3240-131231-0011.flac,IN THE LONDON TIMES JULY FOURTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE THERE IS AN ACCOUNT OF A SHOWER OF TWIGS AND LEAVES AND TINY TOADS IN A STORM UPON THE SLOPES OF THE APENNINES THESE MAY HAVE BEEN THE EJECTAMENTA OF A WHIRLWIND I ADD HOWEVER
3240-131231-0012.flac,THAT I HAVE NOTES UPON TWO OTHER FALLS OF TINY TOADS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE ONE IN FRANCE AND ONE IN TAHITI ALSO OF FISH IN SCOTLAND BUT IN THE PHENOMENON OF THE APENNINES THE MIXTURE SEEMS TO ME TO BE TYPICAL OF THE PRODUCTS OF A WHIRLWIND
3240-131231-0013.flac,THE OTHER INSTANCES SEEM TO ME TO BE TYPICAL OF SOMETHING LIKE MIGRATION THEIR GREAT NUMBERS AND THEIR HOMOGENEITY OVER AND OVER IN THESE ANNALS OF THE DAMNED OCCURS THE DATUM OF SEGREGATION
3240-131231-0014.flac,BUT A WHIRLWIND IS THOUGHT OF AS A CONDITION OF CHAOS QUASI CHAOS
3240-131231-0015.flac,MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JULY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE A SMALL POND IN THE TRACK OF THE CLOUD WAS SUCKED DRY THE WATER BEING CARRIED OVER THE ADJOINING FIELDS TOGETHER WITH A LARGE QUANTITY OF SOFT MUD WHICH WAS SCATTERED OVER THE GROUND FOR HALF A MILE AROUND
3240-131231-0016.flac,BUT HERE ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A SCOOP IN THE EXCLUSIONIST IMAGINATION THERE IS NO REGARD FOR MUD DEBRIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF A POND FLOATING VEGETATION LOOSE THINGS FROM THE SHORES BUT A PRECISE PICKING OUT OF FROGS ONLY
3240-131231-0017.flac,OF ALL INSTANCES I HAVE THAT ATTRIBUTE THE FALL OF SMALL FROGS OR TOADS TO WHIRLWINDS ONLY ONE DEFINITELY IDENTIFIES OR PLACES THE WHIRLWIND ALSO AS HAS BEEN SAID BEFORE A POND GOING UP WOULD BE QUITE AS INTERESTING AS FROGS COMING DOWN
3240-131231-0018.flac,WHIRLWINDS WE READ OF OVER AND OVER BUT WHERE AND WHAT WHIRLWIND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANYBODY WHO HAD LOST A POND WOULD BE HEARD FROM IN SYMONS METEOROLOGICAL MAGAZINE
3240-131231-0019.flac,A FALL OF SMALL FROGS NEAR BIRMINGHAM ENGLAND JUNE THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO IS ATTRIBUTED TO A SPECIFIC WHIRLWIND BUT NOT A WORD AS TO ANY SPECIAL POND THAT HAD CONTRIBUTED
3240-131231-0020.flac,AND SOMETHING THAT STRIKES MY ATTENTION HERE IS THAT THESE FROGS ARE DESCRIBED AS ALMOST WHITE I'M AFRAID THERE IS NO ESCAPE FOR US WE SHALL HAVE TO GIVE TO CIVILIZATION UPON THIS EARTH SOME NEW WORLDS PLACES WITH WHITE FROGS IN THEM
3240-131231-0021.flac,IN SPITE OF ALL WE THINK WE KNOW OF THE ACCELERATIVE VELOCITY OF FALLING BODIES AND HAVE PROPAGATED WHY THE EXOTIC BECOMES THE INDIGENOUS OR FROM THE STRANGEST OF PLACES WE'D EXPECT THE FAMILIAR OR
3240-131231-0022.flac,IF HOSTS OF LIVING FROGS HAVE COME HERE FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE EVERY LIVING THING UPON THIS EARTH MAY ANCESTRALLY HAVE COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE I FIND THAT I HAVE ANOTHER NOTE UPON A SPECIFIC HURRICANE
3240-131231-0023.flac,AFTER ONE OF THE GREATEST HURRICANES IN THE HISTORY OF IRELAND SOME FISH WERE FOUND AS FAR AS FIFTEEN YARDS FROM THE EDGE OF A LAKE HAVE ANOTHER THIS IS A GOOD ONE FOR THE EXCLUSIONISTS FALL OF FISH IN PARIS SAID THAT A NEIGHBORING POND HAD BEEN BLOWN DRY
3240-131231-0024.flac,DATE NOT GIVEN BUT I HAVE SEEN IT RECORDED SOMEWHERE ELSE THE BEST KNOWN FALL OF FISHES FROM THE SKY IS THAT WHICH OCCURRED AT MOUNTAIN ASH
3240-131231-0025.flac,FEBRUARY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE THE EDITOR OF THE ZOOLOGIST
3240-131231-0026.flac,HAVING PUBLISHED A REPORT OF A FALL OF FISHES WRITES I AM CONTINUALLY RECEIVING SIMILAR ACCOUNTS OF FROGS AND FISHES BUT IN ALL THE VOLUMES OF THE ZOOLOGIST I CAN FIND ONLY TWO REPORTS OF SUCH FALLS THERE IS NOTHING TO CONCLUDE
3240-131231-0027.flac,OTHER THAN THAT HOSTS OF DATA HAVE BEEN LOST BECAUSE ORTHODOXY DOES NOT LOOK FAVORABLY UPON SUCH REPORTS THE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW RECORDS SEVERAL FALLS OF FISHES IN THE UNITED STATES
3240-131231-0028.flac,NEVERTHELESS THE TREATMENT BY THE ZOOLOGIST OF THE FALL REPORTED FROM MOUNTAIN ASH IS FAIR FIRST APPEARS
3240-131231-0029.flac,VICAR OF ABEDARE ASSERTING THAT THE FALL HAD OCCURRED CHIEFLY UPON THE PROPERTY OF MISTER NIXON OF MOUNTAIN ASH
3240-131231-0030.flac,OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM BRISTLING WITH EXCLUSIONISM WRITES THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM ALIVE WERE VERY YOUNG MINNOWS HE SAYS ON READING THE EVIDENCE IT SEEMS TO ME MOST PROBABLY ONLY A PRACTICAL JOKE
3240-131231-0031.flac,THE EDITOR SAYS THAT ONE WAS A MINNOW AND THAT THE REST WERE STICKLEBACKS HE SAYS THAT DOCTOR GRAY'S EXPLANATION IS NO DOUBT RIGHT BUT
3240-131231-0032.flac,HE PUBLISHES A LETTER FROM ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT WHO APOLOGIZES FOR OPPOSING SO HIGH AN AUTHORITY AS DOCTOR GRAY BUT SAYS THAT HE HAD OBTAINED SOME OF THESE FISHES FROM PERSONS WHO LIVED AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE APART
3240-131231-0033.flac,OR CONSIDERABLY OUT OF RANGE OF THE PLAYFUL PAIL OF WATER ACCORDING TO THE ANNUAL REGISTER
3240-131231-0034.flac,THE FISHES THEMSELVES HAD FALLEN BY PAILFULS IF THESE FISHES WERE NOT UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE WE BASE OUR OBJECTIONS TO THE WHIRLWIND EXPLANATION UPON TWO DATA THAT THEY FELL IN NO SUCH DISTRIBUTION AS ONE COULD ATTRIBUTE TO THE DISCHARGE OF A WHIRLWIND
3240-131231-0035.flac,THAT TEN MINUTES LATER ANOTHER FALL OF FISHES OCCURRED UPON THIS SAME NARROW STRIP OF LAND EVEN ARGUING THAT A WHIRLWIND MAY STAND STILL AXIALLY IT DISCHARGES TANGENTIALLY WHEREVER THE FISHES CAME FROM IT DOES NOT SEEM THINKABLE
3240-131231-0036.flac,THAT SOME COULD HAVE FALLEN AND THAT OTHERS COULD HAVE WHIRLED EVEN A TENTH OF A MINUTE THEN FALLING DIRECTLY AFTER THE FIRST TO FALL BECAUSE OF THESE EVIL CIRCUMSTANCES THE BEST ADAPTATION WAS TO LAUGH THE WHOLE THING OFF
3240-131231-0037.flac,VERY YOUNG MINNOWS HAD BEEN CAUGHT UP IN THE LONDON TIMES MARCH SECOND EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE IS A LETTER FROM MISTER AARON ROBERTS CURATE OF SAINT PETER'S CARMATHON IN THIS LETTER
3240-131231-0038.flac,BUT THERE IS SOME QUESTION OF SPECIES I THINK MYSELF THAT THEY WERE MINNOWS AND STICKLEBACKS SOME PERSONS THINKING THEM TO BE SEA FISHES PLACED THEM IN SALT WATER ACCORDING TO MISTER ROBERTS
3240-131231-0039.flac,SOME WERE PLACED IN FRESH WATER THESE SEEMED TO THRIVE WELL AS TO NARROW DISTRIBUTION WE ARE TOLD THAT THE FISHES FELL IN AND ABOUT THE PREMISES OF MISTER NIXON IT WAS NOT OBSERVED AT THE TIME THAT ANY FISH FELL IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
3240-131231-0040.flac,SAVE IN THE PARTICULAR SPOT MENTIONED IN THE LONDON TIMES MARCH TENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE VICAR GRIFFITH WRITES AN ACCOUNT THE ROOFS OF SOME HOUSES WERE COVERED WITH THEM
3240-131231-0041.flac,IN THIS LETTER IT IS SAID THAT THE LARGEST FISHES WERE FIVE INCHES LONG AND THAT THESE DID NOT SURVIVE THE FALL REPORT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION
3240-131231-0042.flac,THE EVIDENCE OF THE FALL OF FISH ON THIS OCCASION WAS VERY CONCLUSIVE A SPECIMEN OF THE FISH WAS EXHIBITED
3240-131231-0043.flac,LEIRUS GASTEROSTEUS IS THE STICKLEBACK ALTOGETHER I THINK WE HAVE NOT A SENSE OF TOTAL PERDITION
3240-131231-0044.flac,IN WHICH WERE THOUSANDS OF FISHES FOUR OR FIVE INCHES LONG SOME OF WHICH COVERED ROOFS OF HOUSES AND SOME OF WHICH REMAINED TEN MINUTES IN THE AIR BY WAY OF CONTRAST WE OFFER OUR OWN ACCEPTANCE THAT THE BOTTOM OF A SUPER GEOGRAPHICAL POND HAD DROPPED OUT
3240-131231-0045.flac,I HAVE A GREAT MANY NOTES UPON THE FALL OF FISHES DESPITE THE DIFFICULTY THESE RECORDS HAVE IN GETTING THEMSELVES PUBLISHED BUT I PICK OUT THE INSTANCES THAT ESPECIALLY RELATE TO OUR SUPER GEOGRAPHICAL ACCEPTANCES
3240-131231-0046.flac,THAT HAVE FALLEN WITH A DISTRIBUTION NARROWER THAN IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A WHIRLWIND THAT HAVE FALLEN FOR A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME UPON THE SAME NARROW AREA OF LAND THESE THREE FACTORS INDICATE SOMEWHERE NOT FAR ALOFT
3240-131231-0047.flac,A REGION OF INERTNESS TO THIS EARTH'S GRAVITATION OF COURSE HOWEVER A REGION THAT BY THE FLUX AND VARIATION OF ALL THINGS MUST AT TIMES BE SUSCEPTIBLE BUT AFTERWARD OUR HERESY WILL BIFURCATE
3240-131231-0048.flac,IN AMIABLE ACCOMMODATION TO THE CRUCIFIXION IT'LL GET I THINK BUT SO IMPRESSED ARE WE WITH THE DATUM THAT THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN MANY REPORTS OF SMALL FROGS THAT HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY
3240-131231-0049.flac,THAT TO THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ANOTHER ADJUSTMENT MUST BE MADE APART FROM OUR THREE FACTORS OF INDICATION AN EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVATION IS THE FALL OF LIVING THINGS WITHOUT INJURY TO THEM
3240-131231-0050.flac,SOMETHING ELSE APART FROM OUR THREE MAIN INTERESTS IS A PHENOMENON THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT ONE MIGHT CALL AN ALTERNATING SERIES OF FALLS OF FISHES WHATEVER THE SIGNIFICANCE MAY BE
3240-131231-0051.flac,JULY EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR LIVING AGE
3240-131231-0052.flac,FIFESHIRE SCOTLAND SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR

3240-131231-0056.flac,FERIDPOOR INDIA FEBRUARY NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY
3240-131231-0057.flac,DISREGARDING SERIAL SIGNIFICANCE OR MECHANICAL UNINTELLIGENT REPULSIVE REFLEX IS THAT THE FISHES OF INDIA DID NOT FALL FROM THE SKY THAT THEY WERE FOUND UPON THE GROUND AFTER TORRENTIAL RAINS BECAUSE STREAMS HAD OVERFLOWED AND HAD THEN RECEDED
3240-131231-0058.flac,IN THE REGION OF INERTNESS THAT WE THINK WE CAN CONCEIVE OF OR A ZONE THAT IS TO THIS EARTH'S GRAVITATION VERY MUCH LIKE THE NEUTRAL ZONE OF A MAGNET'S ATTRACTION WE ACCEPT THAT THERE ARE BODIES OF WATER AND ALSO CLEAR SPACES BOTTOMS OF PONDS DROPPING OUT
3240-131231-0059.flac,REMAIN AND DRY OR EVEN PUTREFY THEN SOMETIMES FALLING BY ATMOSPHERIC DISLODGMENT AFTER A TREMENDOUS DELUGE OF RAIN ONE OF THE HEAVIEST FALLS ON RECORD
3240-131231-0060.flac,JULY TWENTY FIFTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY
3240-131231-0061.flac,THE WORD FOUND IS AGREEABLE TO THE REPULSIONS OF THE CONVENTIONALISTS AND THEIR CONCEPT OF AN OVERFLOWING STREAM BUT ACCORDING TO DOCTOR BUIST SOME OF THESE FISHES WERE FOUND ON THE TOPS OF HAYSTACKS FERREL
3240-131231-0062.flac,TELLS OF A FALL OF LIVING FISHES SOME OF THEM HAVING BEEN PLACED IN A TANK WHERE THEY SURVIVED THAT OCCURRED IN INDIA ABOUT TWENTY MILES SOUTH OF CALCUTTA SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE A WITNESS OF THIS FALL SAYS
3240-131231-0063.flac,THE MOST STRANGE THING WHICH EVER STRUCK ME WAS THAT THE FISH DID NOT FALL HELTER SKELTER OR HERE AND THERE BUT THEY FELL IN A STRAIGHT LINE NOT MORE THAN A CUBIT IN BREADTH
3240-131231-0064.flac,THAT ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY TAKEN BEFORE A MAGISTRATE A FALL OCCURRED FEBRUARY NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NEAR FERIDPOOR INDIA OF MANY FISHES OF VARIOUS SIZES SOME WHOLE AND FRESH AND OTHERS MUTILATED AND PUTREFYING
3240-131231-0065.flac,OR TO THOSE WHO HOLD OUT FOR SEGREGATION IN A WHIRLWIND OR THAT OBJECTS SAY TWICE AS HEAVY AS OTHERS WOULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE LIGHTER WE POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WERE TWICE AS HEAVY AS OTHERS IN THE JOURNAL OF THE ASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL
3240-131231-0066.flac,SOME OF THE FISH WERE FRESH BUT OTHERS WERE ROTTEN AND WITHOUT HEADS AMONG THE NUMBER WHICH I GOT FIVE WERE FRESH AND THE REST STINKING AND HEADLESS THEY REMIND US OF HIS GRACE'S OBSERVATION OF SOME PAGES BACK
3240-131231-0067.flac,ACCORDING TO DOCTOR BUIST SOME OF THESE FISHES WEIGHED ONE AND A HALF POUNDS EACH AND OTHERS THREE POUNDS A FALL OF FISHES AT FUTTEPOOR INDIA MAY SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE THEY WERE ALL DEAD AND DRY
3240-131231-0068.flac,A CORRESPONDENT WRITES FROM THE DOVE MARINE LABORATORY CUTTERCOATS ENGLAND THAT AT HINDON A SUBURB OF SUNDERLAND AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS OF SMALL FISHES IDENTIFIED AS SAND EELS HAD FALLEN
3240-131231-0069.flac,AGAIN THE SMALL AREA ABOUT SIXTY BY THIRTY YARDS THE FALL OCCURRED DURING A HEAVY RAIN THAT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THUNDER
3240-131231-0070.flac,BUT BY NO VISIBLE LIGHTNING THE SEA IS CLOSE TO HINDON BUT IF YOU TRY TO THINK OF THESE FISHES HAVING DESCRIBED A TRAJECTORY IN A WHIRLWIND FROM THE OCEAN CONSIDER THIS REMARKABLE DATUM THAT
3240-131231-0071.flac,ACCORDING TO WITNESSES THE FALL UPON THIS SMALL AREA OCCUPIED TEN MINUTES I CANNOT THINK OF A CLEARER INDICATION OF A DIRECT FALL FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE AND
3240-131231-0072.flac,THE FISH WERE ALL DEAD AND INDEED STIFF AND HARD WHEN PICKED UP IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OCCURRENCE BY ALL OF WHICH I MEAN THAT WE HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO PILE UP OUR DATA OF THINGS THAT FALL FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE OVERHEAD
3240-131231-0073.flac,WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE UP THE SUBJECT FROM MANY APPROACHES BEFORE OUR ACCEPTANCE WHICH SEEMS QUITE AS RIGOROUSLY ARRIVED AT AS EVER HAS BEEN A BELIEF CAN EMERGE FROM THE ACCURSED I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE HORSE AND THE BARN WILL HELP US TO EMERGE
3240-131231-0074.flac,BUT IF EVER ANYTHING DID GO UP FROM THIS EARTH'S SURFACE AND STAY UP THOSE DAMNED THINGS MAY HAVE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IN A TORNADO IN WISCONSIN MAY TWENTY THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0075.flac,A BARN AND A HORSE WERE CARRIED COMPLETELY AWAY AND NEITHER HORSE NOR BARN NOR ANY PORTION OF EITHER HAVE SINCE BEEN FOUND AFTER THAT WHICH WOULD BE A LITTLE STRONG WERE IT NOT FOR A STEADY IMPROVEMENT IN OUR DIGESTIONS THAT I NOTE AS WE GO ALONG
3240-131231-0076.flac,THERE IS LITTLE OF THE BIZARRE OR THE UNASSIMILABLE IN THE TURTLE THAT HOVERED SIX MONTHS OR SO OVER A SMALL TOWN IN MISSISSIPPI MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
3240-131231-0077.flac,FELL A SMALL PIECE OF ALABASTER THAT AT BOVINA EIGHT MILES FROM VICKSBURG FELL A GOPHER TURTLE THEY FELL IN A HAILSTORM THIS ITEM WAS WIDELY COPIED AT THE TIME FOR INSTANCE NATURE
3240-131231-0078.flac,AS TO DISCUSSION NOT A WORD OR SCIENCE AND ITS CONTINUITY WITH PRESBYTERIANISM DATA LIKE THIS ARE DAMNED AT BIRTH THE WEATHER REVIEW DOES SPRINKLE OR BAPTIZE OR ATTEMPT TO SAVE THIS INFANT
3240-131231-0079.flac,BUT IN ALL THE METEOROLOGICAL LITERATURE THAT I HAVE GONE THROUGH AFTER THAT DATE NOT A WORD EXCEPT MENTION ONCE OR TWICE THE EDITOR OF THE REVIEW SAYS
3240-131231-0080.flac,AN EXAMINATION OF THE WEATHER MAP SHOWS THAT THESE HAILSTORMS OCCUR ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF A REGION OF COLD NORTHERLY WINDS AND WERE BUT A SMALL PART OF A SERIES OF SIMILAR STORMS
3240-131231-0081.flac,OF ALL INCREDIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE FROM I GIVE FIRST PLACE TO A NOTION OF A WHIRLWIND POUNCING UPON A REGION
3240-131231-0082.flac,THIS TIME THE OTHER MECHANICAL THING THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE CANNOT RISE IN RESPONSE TO ITS STIMULUS IT IS RESISTED IN THAT THESE OBJECTS WERE COATED WITH ICE MONTH OF MAY IN A SOUTHERN STATE IF A WHIRLWIND AT ALL
3240-131231-0083.flac,THERE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED SELECTION THERE IS NO RECORD OF THE FALL OF OTHER OBJECTS BUT THERE IS NO ATTEMPT IN THE REVIEW TO SPECIFY A WHIRLWIND THESE STRANGELY ASSOCIATED THINGS WERE REMARKABLY SEPARATED THEY FELL EIGHT MILES APART
3240-131231-0084.flac,THEN AS IF THERE WERE REAL REASONING THEY MUST HAVE BEEN HIGH TO FALL WITH SUCH DIVERGENCE OR ONE OF THEM MUST HAVE BEEN CARRIED PARTLY HORIZONTALLY EIGHT MILES FARTHER THAN THE OTHER BUT EITHER SUPPOSITION ARGUES FOR POWER MORE THAN THAT OF A LOCAL WHIRL OR GUST
3240-131231-0085.flac,OR ARGUES FOR A GREAT SPECIFIC DISTURBANCE OF WHICH THERE IS NO RECORD FOR THE MONTH OF MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
3240-131232-0000.flac,THEN I THINK OF A HURRICANE THAT OCCURRED IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI WEEKS OR MONTHS BEFORE MAY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR NO I DON'T LOOK FOR IT AND INEVITABLY FIND IT OR THAT THINGS CAN GO UP SO HIGH IN HURRICANES THAT THEY STAY UP INDEFINITELY
3240-131232-0001.flac,BUT MAY AFTER A WHILE BE SHAKEN DOWN BY STORMS
3240-131232-0002.flac,SO THEN THAT THE TURTLE AND THE PIECE OF ALABASTER MAY HAVE HAD FAR DIFFERENT ORIGINS FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS PERHAPS HAVE ENTERED A REGION OF SUSPENSION OVER THIS EARTH WAFTING NEAR EACH OTHER LONG DURATION
3240-131232-0003.flac,FINAL PRECIPITATION BY ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE WITH HAIL OR THAT HAILSTONES TOO WHEN LARGE ARE PHENOMENA OF SUSPENSION OF LONG DURATION THAT IT IS HIGHLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE VERY LARGE ONES COULD BECOME SO GREAT ONLY IN FALLING FROM THE CLOUDS
3240-131232-0004.flac,LONG DURATION OTHER INDICATIONS OF LONG DURATION I THINK OF A REGION SOMEWHERE ABOVE THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN WHICH GRAVITATION IS INOPERATIVE AND IS NOT GOVERNED BY THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE
3240-131232-0005.flac,QUITE AS MAGNETISM IS NEGLIGIBLE AT A VERY SHORT DISTANCE FROM A MAGNET THEORETICALLY THE ATTRACTION OF A MAGNET SHOULD DECREASE WITH THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BUT THE FALLING OFF IS FOUND TO BE ALMOST ABRUPT AT A SHORT DISTANCE
3240-131232-0006.flac,HORSES AND BARNS AND ELEPHANTS AND FLIES AND DODOES MOAS AND PTERODACTYLS LEAVES FROM MODERN TREES AND LEAVES OF THE CARBONIFEROUS ERA ALL HOWEVER TENDING TO DISINTEGRATE INTO HOMOGENEOUS LOOKING MUDS OR DUSTS
3240-131232-0007.flac,RED OR BLACK OR YELLOW TREASURE TROVES FOR THE PALAEONTOLOGISTS AND FOR THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ACCUMULATIONS OF CENTURIES CYCLONES OF EGYPT GREECE AND ASSYRIA FISHES DRIED AND HARD THERE A SHORT TIME OTHERS THERE LONG ENOUGH TO PUTREFY
3240-131232-0008.flac,BUT THE OMNIPRESENCE OF HETEROGENEITY OR LIVING FISHES ALSO PONDS OF FRESH WATER OCEANS OF SALT WATER AS TO THE LAW OF GRAVITATION I PREFER TO TAKE ONE SIMPLE STAND
3240-131232-0009.flac,ORTHODOXY ACCEPTS THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES GRAVITATION IS ONE OF THESE FORCES ALL OTHER FORCES HAVE PHENOMENA OF REPULSION AND OF INERTNESS IRRESPECTIVE OF DISTANCE AS WELL AS OF ATTRACTION
3240-131232-0010.flac,BUT NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION ADMITS ATTRACTION ONLY THEN NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION CAN BE ONLY ONE THIRD ACCEPTABLE EVEN TO THE ORTHODOX OR THERE IS DENIAL OF THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES OR STILL SIMPLER HERE ARE THE DATA
3240-131232-0011.flac,THOUGH IT HARMONIZES WITH DATA OF FISHES THAT FALL AS IF FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE AND OF COURSE WITH OTHER DATA TOO IS INADEQUATE TO ACCOUNT FOR TWO PECULIARITIES OF THE FALLS OF FROGS THAT NEVER HAS A FALL OF TADPOLES BEEN REPORTED
3240-131232-0012.flac,THAT NEVER HAS A FALL OF FULL GROWN FROGS BEEN REPORTED ALWAYS FROGS A FEW MONTHS OLD IT SOUNDS POSITIVE BUT IF THERE BE SUCH REPORTS THEY ARE SOMEWHERE OUT OF MY RANGE OF READING BUT TADPOLES WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SKY THAN WOULD FROGS
3240-131232-0013.flac,LITTLE OR BIG IF SUCH FALLS BE ATTRIBUTED TO WHIRLWINDS AND MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA IF THOUGH VERY TENTATIVELY AND PROVISIONALLY WE ACCEPT THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA
3240-131232-0014.flac,BEFORE WE TAKE UP AN ESPECIAL EXPRESSION UPON THE FALL OF IMMATURE AND LARVAL FORMS OF LIFE TO THIS EARTH AND THE NECESSITY THEN OF CONCEIVING OF SOME FACTOR BESIDES MERE STATIONARINESS OR SUSPENSION OR STAGNATION
3240-131232-0015.flac,THERE ARE OTHER DATA THAT ARE SIMILAR TO DATA OF FALLS OF FISHES SCIENCE GOSSIP
3240-131232-0016.flac,THAT SMALL SNAILS OF A LAND SPECIES HAD FALLEN NEAR REDRUTH CORNWALL JULY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX DURING A HEAVY THUNDERSTORM ROADS AND FIELDS STREWN WITH THEM SO THAT THEY WERE GATHERED UP BY THE HATFUL
3240-131232-0017.flac,NONE SEEN TO FALL BY THE WRITER OF THIS ACCOUNT SNAILS SAID TO BE QUITE DIFFERENT TO ANY PREVIOUSLY KNOWN IN THIS DISTRICT
3240-131232-0018.flac,OF GREAT AND DESERVED REPUTE I THOUGHT I SHOULD FOR ONCE LIKE TO TRACE THE ORIGIN OF ONE OF THESE FABULOUS TALES OUR OWN ACCEPTANCE IS THAT JUSTICE CANNOT BE IN AN INTERMEDIATE EXISTENCE
3240-131232-0019.flac,IN WHICH THERE CAN BE APPROXIMATION ONLY TO JUSTICE OR TO INJUSTICE THAT TO BE FAIR IS TO HAVE NO OPINION AT ALL THAT TO BE HONEST IS TO BE UNINTERESTED THAT TO INVESTIGATE IS TO ADMIT PREJUDICE THAT NOBODY HAS EVER REALLY INVESTIGATED ANYTHING
3240-131232-0020.flac,BUT HAS ALWAYS SOUGHT POSITIVELY TO PROVE OR TO DISPROVE SOMETHING THAT WAS CONCEIVED OF OR SUSPECTED IN ADVANCE AS I SUSPECTED SAYS THIS CORRESPONDENT I FOUND THAT THE SNAILS WERE OF A FAMILIAR LAND SPECIES THAT THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND
3240-131232-0021.flac,IN THE FIRST PLACE HE FOUND THAT THE SNAILS HAD APPEARED AFTER THE RAIN THAT ASTONISHED RUSTICS HAD JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY HAD FALLEN HE MET ONE PERSON WHO SAID THAT HE HAD SEEN THE SNAILS FALL THIS WAS HIS ERROR SAYS THE INVESTIGATOR
3240-131232-0022.flac,IN SUCH QUANTITIES THAT THEY WERE SHOVELED UP IT IS SAID THAT THE SNAILS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A LOCAL SPECIES
3240-131232-0023.flac,AND THAT IN HIS OPINION THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME UNUSUAL CONDITION ALOFT COMES OUT IN HIS OBSERVATION UPON THE CURIOUS AZURE BLUE APPEARANCE OF THE SUN AT THE TIME
3240-131232-0024.flac,THAT ACCORDING TO DAS WETTER DECEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO UPON AUGUST NINTH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO A YELLOW CLOUD APPEARED OVER PADERBORN GERMANY FROM THIS CLOUD FELL A TORRENTIAL RAIN IN WHICH WERE HUNDREDS OF MUSSELS
3240-131232-0025.flac,THERE IS NO MENTION OF WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE NOR OF A WHIRLWIND LIZARDS
3240-131232-0026.flac,THAT DURING A HEAVY SHOWER JULY THIRD EIGHTEEN SIXTY HE HEARD A PECULIAR SOUND AT HIS FEET AND LOOKING DOWN SAW A SNAKE LYING AS IF STUNNED BY A FALL IT THEN CAME TO LIFE GRAY SNAKE ABOUT A FOOT LONG
3240-131232-0027.flac,THESE DATA HAVE ANY MEANING OR LACK OF MEANING OR DEGREE OF DAMNATION YOU PLEASE BUT IN THE MATTER OF THE FALL THAT OCCURRED AT MEMPHIS TENNESSEE OCCUR SOME STRONG SIGNIFICANCES
3240-131232-0028.flac,OUR QUASI REASONING UPON THIS SUBJECT APPLIES TO ALL SEGREGATIONS SO FAR CONSIDERED MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THAT
3240-131232-0029.flac,RATHER STRICTLY LOCALIZED OR IN A SPACE OF TWO BLOCKS AND AFTER A VIOLENT STORM IN WHICH THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS SNAKES WERE FOUND THEY WERE CRAWLING ON SIDEWALKS IN YARDS AND IN STREETS AND IN MASSES
3240-131232-0030.flac,BUT NONE WERE FOUND ON ROOFS OR ANY OTHER ELEVATION ABOVE GROUND AND NONE WERE SEEN TO FALL IF YOU PREFER TO BELIEVE THAT THE SNAKES HAD ALWAYS BEEN THERE OR HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT IT WAS ONLY THAT SOMETHING OCCURRED TO CALL SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THEM
3240-131232-0031.flac,IN THE STREETS OF MEMPHIS JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHY THAT'S SENSIBLE THAT'S THE COMMON SENSE THAT HAS BEEN AGAINST US FROM THE FIRST IT IS NOT SAID WHETHER THE SNAKES WERE OF A KNOWN SPECIES OR NOT
3240-131232-0032.flac,AND HAD NOT BEEN IN THE STREETS CRAWLING LOOSE OR IN THICK TANGLED MASSES IN THE FIRST PLACE IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT THESE SNAKES HAD BEEN RAISED FROM SOME OTHER PART OF THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN A WHIRLWIND IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT A WHIRLWIND COULD SEGREGATE THEM
3240-131232-0033.flac,STONES FENCE RAILS LIMBS OF TREES SAY THAT THE SNAKES OCCUPIED THE NEXT GRADATION AND WOULD BE THE NEXT TO FALL
3240-131232-0034.flac,AGAIN OURS IS THE OBJECTION AGAINST SUCH SELECTIVENESS BY A WHIRLWIND CONCEIVABLY A WHIRLWIND COULD SCOOP OUT A DEN OF HIBERNATING SNAKES WITH STONES AND EARTH AND AN INFINITUDE OF OTHER DEBRIS SNATCHING UP DOZENS OF SNAKES
3240-131232-0035.flac,I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TO A DEN HUNDREDS MAYBE BUT ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT OF THIS OCCURRENCE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM ALIVE FROM ONE FOOT TO EIGHTEEN INCHES IN LENGTH
3240-131232-0036.flac,RECORDS THE FALL AND SAYS THAT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM THE USUAL WHIRLWIND EXPLANATION IS GIVEN BUT IN WHAT LOCALITY SNAKES EXIST IN SUCH ABUNDANCE IS YET A MYSTERY THIS MATTER OF ENORMOUSNESS OF NUMBERS
3240-131232-0037.flac,SUGGESTS TO ME SOMETHING OF A MIGRATORY NATURE BUT THAT SNAKES IN THE UNITED STATES DO NOT MIGRATE IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY IF EVER AS TO FALLS OR FLUTTERINGS OF WINGED INSECTS FROM THE SKY PREVAILING NOTIONS OF SWARMING WOULD SEEM EXPLANATORY ENOUGH
3240-131232-0038.flac,FALL OF FISHES JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE IN HOLLAND ANTS AUGUST FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE STRASBOURG LITTLE TOADS AUGUST SECOND EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE SAVOY
3240-131232-0039.flac,FALL OF ANTS CAMBRIDGE ENGLAND SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR SOME WERE WINGLESS
3240-131232-0040.flac,ENORMOUS FALL OF ANTS NANCY FRANCE JULY TWENTY FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN MOST OF THEM WERE WINGLESS
4397-15668-0000.flac,YOU MAY WALK THE DESERTS OF THE GREAT BASIN IN THE BLOOM TIME OF THE YEAR ALL THE WAY ACROSS FROM THE SNOWY SIERRA TO THE SNOWY WAHSATCH AND YOUR EYES WILL BE FILLED WITH MANY A GAY MALVA AND POPPY AND ABRONIA AND CACTUS
4397-15668-0001.flac,BUT YOU MAY NOT SEE A SINGLE TRUE LILY AND ONLY A VERY FEW LILIACEOUS PLANTS OF ANY KIND NOT EVEN IN THE COOL FRESH GLENS OF THE MOUNTAINS WILL YOU FIND THESE FAVORITE FLOWERS THOUGH SOME OF THESE DESERT RANGES ALMOST RIVAL THE SIERRA IN HEIGHT
4397-15668-0002.flac,NEVERTHELESS IN THE BUILDING AND PLANTING OF THIS GRAND TERRITORY THE LILIES WERE NOT FORGOTTEN FAR BACK IN THE DIM GEOLOGIC AGES WHEN THE SEDIMENTS OF THE OLD SEAS WERE BEING GATHERED AND OUTSPREAD IN SMOOTH SHEETS LIKE LEAVES OF A BOOK
4397-15668-0003.flac,AND WHEN THESE SEDIMENTS BECAME DRY LAND AND WERE BAKED AND CRUMBLED INTO THE SKY AS MOUNTAIN RANGES WHEN THE LAVA FLOODS OF THE FIRE PERIOD WERE BEING LAVISHLY POURED FORTH FROM INNUMERABLE RIFTS AND CRATERS
4397-15668-0004.flac,WHEN THE ICE OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD WAS LAID LIKE A MANTLE OVER EVERY MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY THROUGHOUT ALL THESE IMMENSELY PROTRACTED PERIODS IN THE THRONG OF THESE MAJESTIC OPERATIONS NATURE KEPT HER FLOWER CHILDREN IN MIND SHE CONSIDERED THE LILIES
4397-15668-0005.flac,AND WHILE PLANTING THE PLAINS WITH SAGE AND THE HILLS WITH CEDAR SHE HAS COVERED AT LEAST ONE MOUNTAIN WITH GOLDEN ERYTHRONIUMS AND FRITILLARIAS AS ITS CROWNING GLORY AS IF WILLING TO SHOW WHAT SHE COULD DO IN THE LILY LINE EVEN HERE
4397-15668-0006.flac,LOOKING SOUTHWARD FROM THE SOUTH END OF SALT LAKE THE TWO NORTHMOST PEAKS OF THE OQUIRRH RANGE ARE SEEN SWELLING CALMLY INTO THE COOL SKY WITHOUT ANY MARKED CHARACTER EXCEPTING ONLY THEIR SNOW CROWNS
4397-15668-0007.flac,AND A FEW WEEDY LOOKING PATCHES OF SPRUCE AND FIR THE SIMPLICITY OF THEIR SLOPES PREVENTING THEIR REAL LOFTINESS FROM BEING APPRECIATED GRAY SAGEY PLAINS CIRCLE AROUND THEIR BASES AND UP TO A HEIGHT OF A THOUSAND FEET OR MORE THEIR SIDES ARE TINGED WITH PURPLE
4397-15668-0008.flac,AND OVER ALL THE SMOOTH CROWN OF SNOW WHILE STANDING AT THEIR FEET THE OTHER DAY SHORTLY AFTER MY MEMORABLE EXCURSION AMONG THE SALT WAVES OF THE LAKE I SAID NOW I SHALL HAVE ANOTHER BAPTISM
4397-15668-0009.flac,I WILL BATHE IN THE HIGH SKY AMONG COOL WIND WAVES FROM THE SNOW FROM THE MORE SOUTHERLY OF THE TWO PEAKS A LONG RIDGE COMES DOWN BENT LIKE A BOW ONE END IN THE HOT PLAINS THE OTHER IN THE SNOW OF THE SUMMIT
4397-15668-0010.flac,AFTER CAREFULLY SCANNING THE JAGGED TOWERS AND BATTLEMENTS WITH WHICH IT IS ROUGHENED I DETERMINED TO MAKE IT MY WAY THOUGH IT PRESENTED BUT A FEEBLE ADVERTISEMENT OF ITS FLORAL WEALTH THIS APPARENT BARRENNESS HOWEVER MADE NO GREAT OBJECTION JUST THEN
4397-15668-0011.flac,I WAS ANIMATED BY A MOUNTAINEER'S EAGERNESS TO GET MY FEET INTO THE SNOW ONCE MORE AND MY HEAD INTO THE CLEAR SKY AFTER LYING DORMANT ALL WINTER AT THE LEVEL OF THE SEA BUT IN EVERY WALK WITH NATURE ONE RECEIVES FAR MORE THAN HE SEEKS
4397-15668-0012.flac,I HAD NOT GONE MORE THAN A MILE FROM LAKE POINT ERE I FOUND THE WAY PROFUSELY DECKED WITH FLOWERS MOSTLY COMPOSITAE AND PURPLE LEGUMINOSAE A HUNDRED COROLLAS OR MORE TO THE SQUARE YARD WITH A CORRESPONDING ABUNDANCE OF WINGED BLOSSOMS ABOVE THEM MOTHS AND BUTTERFLIES
4397-15668-0013.flac,TWO LILIACEOUS PLANTS IN PARTICULAR ERYTHRONIUM GRANDIFLORUM AND FRITILLARIA PUDICA ARE MARVELOUSLY BEAUTIFUL AND ABUNDANT
4397-15668-0014.flac,NEVER BEFORE IN ALL MY WALKS HAVE I MET SO GLORIOUS A THRONG OF THESE FINE SHOWY LILIACEOUS PLANTS THE WHOLE MOUNTAINSIDE WAS AGLOW WITH THEM FROM A HEIGHT OF FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE SNOW
4397-15668-0015.flac,ON THE UPPER SIDE WHERE THE BUSHES WERE MORE OPEN BUT A COMPANY COMPOSED OF THE TWO LILIES I HAVE MENTIONED WERE BLOOMING ON THE LOWER SIDE AND THOUGH THEY WERE AS YET OUT OF SIGHT I SUDDENLY CHANGED MY MIND AND WENT DOWN TO MEET THEM
4397-15668-0016.flac,AS IF ATTRACTED BY THE RINGING OF THEIR BELLS THEY WERE GROWING IN A SMALL NESTLIKE OPENING BETWEEN THE ROCK AND THE BUSHES AND BOTH THE ERYTHRONIUM AND THE FRITILLARIA WERE IN FULL FLOWER THESE WERE THE FIRST OF THE SPECIES I HAD SEEN
4397-15668-0017.flac,AND I NEED NOT TRY TO TELL THE JOY THEY MADE THEY ARE BOTH LOWLY PLANTS LOWLY AS VIOLETS THE TALLEST SELDOM EXCEEDING SIX INCHES IN HEIGHT SO THAT THE MOST SEARCHING WINDS THAT SWEEP THE MOUNTAINS SCARCE REACH LOW ENOUGH TO SHAKE THEIR BELLS
4397-15668-0018.flac,THE PETALS BEING STRONGLY RECURVED LIKE THOSE OF LILIUM SUPERBUM OCCASIONALLY A SPECIMEN IS MET WHICH HAS FROM TWO TO FIVE FLOWERS HUNG IN A LOOSE PANICLE PEOPLE OFTENTIMES TRAVEL FAR TO SEE CURIOUS PLANTS LIKE THE CARNIVOROUS DARLINGTONIA
4397-15668-0019.flac,THE FLY CATCHER THE WALKING FERN ET CETERA I HARDLY KNOW HOW THE LITTLE BELLS I HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING WOULD BE REGARDED BY SEEKERS OF THIS CLASS BUT EVERY TRUE FLOWER LOVER WHO COMES TO CONSIDER THESE UTAH LILIES WILL SURELY BE WELL REWARDED HOWEVER LONG THE WAY
4397-15668-0020.flac,PUSHING ON UP THE RUGGED SLOPES I FOUND MANY DELIGHTFUL SECLUSIONS MOIST NOOKS AT THE FOOT OF CLIFFS AND LILIES IN EVERY ONE OF THEM NOT GROWING CLOSE TOGETHER LIKE DAISIES BUT WELL APART WITH PLENTY OF ROOM FOR THEIR BELLS TO SWING FREE AND RING
4397-15668-0021.flac,I FOUND HUNDREDS OF THEM IN FULL BLOOM WITHIN TWO FEET OF THE SNOW IN WINTER ONLY THE BULBS ARE ALIVE SLEEPING DEEP BENEATH THE GROUND LIKE FIELD MICE IN THEIR NESTS THEN THE SNOW FLOWERS FALL ABOVE THEM LILIES OVER LILIES
4397-15668-0022.flac,UNTIL THE SPRING WINDS BLOW AND THESE WINTER LILIES WITHER IN TURN THEN THE HIDING ERYTHRONIUMS AND FRITILLARIAS RISE AGAIN RESPONSIVE TO THE FIRST TOUCHES OF THE SUN I NOTICED THE TRACKS OF DEER IN MANY PLACES AMONG THE LILY GARDENS
4397-15668-0023.flac,AND AT THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND FEET I CAME UPON THE FRESH TRAIL OF A FLOCK OF WILD SHEEP SHOWING THAT THESE FINE MOUNTAINEERS STILL FLOURISH HERE ABOVE THE RANGE OF MORMON RIFLES IN THE PLANTING OF HER WILD GARDENS
4397-15668-0024.flac,NATURE TAKES THE FEET AND TEETH OF HER FLOCKS INTO ACCOUNT AND MAKES USE OF THEM TO TRIM AND CULTIVATE AND KEEP THEM IN ORDER AS THE BARK AND BUDS OF THE TREE ARE TENDED BY WOODPECKERS AND LINNETS THE EVERGREEN WOODS CONSIST AS FAR AS I OBSERVED OF TWO SPECIES
4397-15668-0025.flac,A SPRUCE AND A FIR STANDING CLOSE TOGETHER ERECT AND ARROWY IN A THRIFTY COMPACT GROWTH BUT THEY ARE QUITE SMALL SAY FROM SIX TO TWELVE OR FOURTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER AND BOUT FORTY FEET IN HEIGHT AMONG THEIR GIANT RELATIVES OF THE SIERRA
4397-15668-0026.flac,SNOWY ICE SCULPTURED RANGES BOUNDED THE HORIZON ALL AROUND WHILE THE GREAT LAKE EIGHTY MILES LONG AND FIFTY MILES WIDE LAY FULLY REVEALED BENEATH A LILY SKY
4397-15668-0027.flac,AND THE WIDE PRAIRIE OF WATER GLOWING IN THE GOLD AND PURPLE OF EVENING PRESENTED ALL THE COLORS THAT TINT THE LIPS OF SHELLS AND THE PETALS OF LILIES THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LAKE THIS SIDE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS UTAH LAKE
4397-15668-0028.flac,LYING THIRTY FIVE MILES TO THE SOUTH WAS IN FULL SIGHT ALSO AND THE RIVER JORDAN WHICH LINKS THE TWO TOGETHER MAY BE TRACED IN SILVERY GLEAMS THROUGHOUT ITS WHOLE COURSE
4397-15668-0029.flac,THE GRANDEST I HAD CARRIED IN MANY A DAY I REACHED THE HOTEL ON THE LAKE ABOUT DUSK WITH ALL MY FRESH RICHES AND MY FIRST MOUNTAIN RAMBLE IN UTAH WAS ACCOMPLISHED ON MY WAY BACK TO THE CITY THE NEXT DAY
4397-15668-0030.flac,I SHOOK MY BIG HANDFUL OF LILIES IN HIS FACE AND SHOUTED HERE ARE THE TRUE SAINTS ANCIENT AND LATTER DAY ENDURING FOREVER
4397-15668-0031.flac,HE SAID THEY ARE NICE
4397-15668-0032.flac,ARE TWO SPECIES OF ZIGADENAS FRITILLARIA ATROPURPUREA
4397-15668-0033.flac,AND THREE OR FOUR HANDSOME ALLIUMS ONE OF THESE LILIES THE CALOCHORTUS SEVERAL SPECIES OF WHICH ARE WELL KNOWN IN CALIFORNIA AS THE MARIPOSA TULIPS HAS RECEIVED GREAT CONSIDERATION AT THE HANDS OF THE MORMONS
4397-15668-0034.flac,FOR TO IT HUNDREDS OF THEM OWE THEIR LIVES DURING THE FAMINE YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT GREAT DESTITUTION PREVAILED ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN SETTLEMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF DROUTH AND GRASSHOPPERS
4397-15668-0035.flac,AND THROUGHOUT ONE HUNGRY WINTER IN PARTICULAR THOUSANDS OF THE PEOPLE SUBSISTED CHIEFLY ON THE BULBS OF THE TULIPS CALLED SEGO BY THE INDIANS WHO TAUGHT THEM ITS USE LILIACEOUS WOMEN AND GIRLS ARE RARE AMONG THE MORMONS
4397-15668-0036.flac,OFTEN CURIOUSLY FRECKLED LIKE THE PETALS OF FRITILLARIA ATROPURPUREA THEY ARE FRUIT RATHER THAN FLOWER GOOD BROWN BREAD BUT DOWN IN THE SAN PITCH VALLEY AT GUNNISON I DISCOVERED A GENUINE LILY HAPPILY NAMED LILY YOUNG
4397-15668-0037.flac,SHE IS A GRANDDAUGHTER OF BRIGHAM YOUNG SLENDER AND GRACEFUL WITH LILY WHITE CHEEKS TINTED WITH CLEAR ROSE SHE WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE OLD SALT LAKE ZION HOUSE BUT BY SOME STRANGE CHANCE
4397-15668-0038.flac,HAS BEEN TRANSPLANTED TO THIS WILDERNESS WHERE SHE BLOOMS ALONE THE LILY OF SAN PITCH PITCH IS AN OLD INDIAN WHO I SUPPOSE PITCHED INTO THE SETTLERS AND THUS ACQUIRED FAME ENOUGH TO GIVE NAME TO THE VALLEY
4397-15668-0039.flac,HERE I FEEL UNEASY ABOUT THE NAME OF THIS LILY FOR THE COMPOSITORS HAVE A PERVERSE TRICK OF MAKING ME SAY ALL KINDS OF ABSURD THINGS WHOLLY UNWARRANTED BY PLAIN COPY AND I FEAR THAT THE LILY OF SAN PITCH WILL APPEAR IN PRINT AS THE WIDOW OF SAM PATCH
4397-15678-0000.flac,AS ONE STROLLS IN THE WOODS ABOUT THE LOGGING CAMPS MOST OF THE LUMBERMEN ARE FOUND TO BE INTERESTING PEOPLE TO MEET KIND AND OBLIGING AND SINCERE FULL OF KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE BARK AND SAPWOOD AND HEARTWOOD OF THE TREES THEY CUT AND HOW TO FELL THEM WITHOUT UNNECESSARY BREAKAGE
4397-15678-0001.flac,A VERY DIFFERENT MAN SEEN NOW AND THEN AT LONG INTERVALS BUT USUALLY INVISIBLE IS THE FREE ROAMER OF THE WILDERNESS HUNTER PROSPECTOR EXPLORER SEEKING HE KNOWS NOT WHAT LITHE AND SINEWY HE WALKS ERECT
4397-15678-0002.flac,MAKING HIS WAY WITH THE SKILL OF WILD ANIMALS ALL HIS SENSES IN ACTION WATCHFUL AND ALERT LOOKING KEENLY AT EVERYTHING IN SIGHT HIS IMAGINATION WELL NOURISHED IN THE WEALTH OF THE WILDERNESS COMING INTO CONTACT WITH FREE NATURE IN A THOUSAND FORMS
4397-15678-0003.flac,HUNGRY AT TIMES AND WEARY HE HAS CORRESPONDING ENJOYMENT IN EATING AND RESTING AND ALL THE WILDERNESS IS HOME SOME OF THESE RARE HAPPY ROVERS DIE ALONE AMONG THE LEAVES
4397-15678-0004.flac,OTHERS HALF SETTLE DOWN AND CHANGE IN PART INTO FARMERS EACH MAKING CHOICE OF SOME FERTILE SPOT WHERE THE LANDSCAPE ATTRACTS HIM BUILDS A SMALL CABIN WHERE WITH FEW WANTS TO SUPPLY FROM GARDEN OR FIELD HE HUNTS AND FARMS IN TURN
4397-15678-0005.flac,UNTIL NIGHT BEGINS TO DRAW NEAR AND LIKE FOREST SHADOWS THICKENS INTO DARKNESS AND HIS DAY IS DONE IN THESE WASHINGTON WILDS LIVING ALONE ALL SORTS OF MEN MAY PERCHANCE BE FOUND POETS PHILOSOPHERS
4397-15678-0006.flac,AND EVEN FULL BLOWN TRANSCENDENTALISTS THOUGH YOU MAY GO FAR TO FIND THEM INDIANS ARE SELDOM TO BE MET WITH AWAY FROM THE SOUND EXCEPTING ABOUT THE FEW OUTLYING HOP RANCHES TO WHICH THEY RESORT IN GREAT NUMBERS DURING THE PICKING SEASON
4397-15678-0007.flac,NOR IN YOUR WALKS IN THE WOODS WILL YOU BE LIKELY TO SEE MANY OF THE WILD ANIMALS HOWEVER FAR YOU MAY GO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL AND THE MOUNTAIN GOAT THE SQUIRREL IS EVERYWHERE AND THE GOAT YOU CAN HARDLY FAIL TO FIND IF YOU CLIMB ANY OF THE HIGH MOUNTAINS THE DEER
4397-15678-0008.flac,TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE BY PLUNGING INTO THE WATER AND SWIMMING TO THE ISLANDS OFF SHORE THE ELK AND PERHAPS ALSO THE MOOSE STILL EXIST IN THE MOST REMOTE AND INACCESSIBLE SOLITUDES OF THE FOREST BUT THEIR NUMBERS HAVE BEEN GREATLY REDUCED OF LATE
4397-15678-0009.flac,AND EVEN THE MOST EXPERIENCED HUNTERS HAVE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THEM OF BEARS THERE ARE TWO SPECIES THE BLACK AND THE LARGE BROWN THE FORMER BY FAR THE MORE COMMON OF THE TWO ON THE SHAGGY BOTTOM LANDS WHERE BERRIES ARE PLENTIFUL
4397-15678-0010.flac,AND ALONG THE RIVERS WHILE SALMON ARE GOING UP TO SPAWN THE BLACK BEAR MAY BE FOUND FAT AND AT HOME MANY ARE KILLED EVERY YEAR BOTH FOR THEIR FLESH AND SKINS THE LARGE BROWN SPECIES LIKES HIGHER AND OPENER GROUND
4397-15678-0011.flac,HE IS A DANGEROUS ANIMAL A NEAR RELATIVE OF THE FAMOUS GRIZZLY AND WISE HUNTERS ARE VERY FOND OF LETTING HIM ALONE THE TOWNS OF PUGET SOUND ARE OF A VERY LIVELY PROGRESSIVE AND ASPIRING KIND
4397-15678-0012.flac,AND THESE TWO ARE KEEN ACTIVE RIVALS TO ALL APPEARANCES WELL MATCHED TACOMA OCCUPIES NEAR THE HEAD OF THE SOUND A SITE OF GREAT NATURAL BEAUTY IT IS THE TERMINUS OF THE NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD AND CALLS ITSELF THE CITY OF DESTINY
4397-15678-0013.flac,SEATTLE IS ALSO CHARMINGLY LOCATED ABOUT TWENTY MILES DOWN THE SOUND FROM TACOMA ON ELLIOTT BAY IT IS THE TERMINUS OF THE SEATTLE LAKE SHORE AND EASTERN RAILROAD NOW IN PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION AND CALLS ITSELF THE QUEEN CITY OF THE SOUND
4397-15678-0014.flac,AMONG THE TREES AND STUMPS AND BRUSH WHICH HIDE A GOOD MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THE STAKES WHICH MARK THE LOTS SO THAT WITHOUT BEING AS YET VERY LARGE TOWNS THEY SEEM TO FADE AWAY INTO THE DISTANCE
4397-15678-0015.flac,PUTTING ON AIRS AS SOME WOULD SAY LIKE BOYS IN HASTE TO BE MEN THEY ARE ALREADY TOWNS WITH ALL MODERN IMPROVEMENTS FIRST CLASS IN EVERY PARTICULAR AS IS SAID OF HOTELS THEY HAVE ELECTRIC MOTORS AND LIGHTS
4397-15678-0016.flac,PAVED BROADWAYS AND BOULEVARDS SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS BLOCKS SCHOOLS CHURCHES FACTORIES AND FOUNDRIES THE LUSTY TITANIC CLANG OF BOILER MAKING MAY BE HEARD THERE
4397-15678-0017.flac,AND PLENTY OF THE LANGUID MUSIC OF PIANOS MINGLING WITH THE BABEL NOISES OF COMMERCE CARRIED ON IN A HUNDRED TONGUES THE MAIN STREETS ARE CROWDED WITH BRIGHT WIDE AWAKE LAWYERS MINISTERS MERCHANTS AGENTS FOR EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN
4397-15678-0018.flac,OX DRIVERS AND LOGGERS IN STIFF GUMMY OVERALLS BACK SLANTING DUDES WELL TAILORED AND SHINY AND FASHIONS AND BONNETS OF EVERY FEATHER AND COLOR BLOOM GAYLY IN THE NOISY THRONG AND ADVERTISE LONDON AND PARIS
4397-15678-0019.flac,VIGOROUS LIFE AND STRIFE ARE TO BE SEEN EVERYWHERE THE SPIRIT OF PROGRESS IS IN THE AIR STILL IT IS HARD TO REALIZE HOW MUCH GOOD WORK IS BEING DONE HERE OF A KIND THAT MAKES FOR CIVILIZATION THE ENTHUSIASTIC EXULTING ENERGY DISPLAYED IN THE BUILDING OF NEW TOWNS
4397-15678-0020.flac,RAILROADS AND MILLS IN THE OPENING OF MINES OF COAL AND IRON AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN GENERAL TO MANY ESPECIALLY IN THE ATLANTIC STATES WASHINGTON IS HARDLY KNOWN AT ALL IT IS REGARDED AS BEING YET A FAR WILD WEST
4397-15678-0021.flac,A DIM NEBULOUS EXPANSE OF WOODS BY THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW THAT RAILROADS AND STEAMERS HAVE BROUGHT THE COUNTRY OUT OF THE WILDERNESS AND ABOLISHED THE OLD DISTANCES IT IS NOW NEAR TO ALL THE WORLD AND IS IN POSSESSION OF A SHARE OF THE BEST OF ALL THAT CIVILIZATION HAS TO OFFER
4397-15678-0022.flac,WHILE ON SOME OF THE LINES OF ADVANCEMENT IT IS AT THE FRONT NOTWITHSTANDING THE SHARP RIVALRY BETWEEN DIFFERENT SECTIONS AND TOWNS THE LEADING MEN MOSTLY PULL TOGETHER FOR THE GENERAL GOOD AND GLORY
4397-15678-0023.flac,BUILDING BUYING BORROWING TO PUSH THE COUNTRY TO ITS PLACE KEEPING ARITHMETIC BUSY IN COUNTING POPULATION PRESENT AND TO COME SHIPS TOWNS FACTORIES TONS OF COAL AND IRON FEET OF LUMBER MILES OF RAILROAD
4397-15678-0024.flac,THEREFORE HOWEVER EXTRAVAGANT AND HIGH THE BRAG ASCENDING FROM PUGET SOUND IN MOST CASES IT IS LIKELY TO APPEAR PARDONABLE AND MORE SEATTLE WAS NAMED AFTER AN OLD INDIAN CHIEF WHO LIVED IN THIS PART OF THE SOUND
4397-15678-0025.flac,HE WAS VERY PROUD OF THE HONOR AND LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO LEAD HIS GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT THE STREETS THE GREATER PART OF THE LOWER BUSINESS PORTION OF THE TOWN INCLUDING A LONG STRETCH OF WHARVES AND WAREHOUSES BUILT ON PILES
4397-15678-0026.flac,THE PEOPLE HOWEVER ARE IN NO WISE DISCOURAGED AND ERE LONG THE LOSS WILL BE GAIN INASMUCH AS A BETTER CLASS OF BUILDINGS CHIEFLY OF BRICK ARE BEING ERECTED IN PLACE OF THE INFLAMMABLE WOODEN ONES WHICH WITH COMPARATIVELY FEW EXCEPTIONS WERE BUILT OF PITCHY SPRUCE
4397-15678-0027.flac,SOME GO BOATING ON THE SOUND OR ON THE LAKES AND RIVERS OR WITH THEIR FAMILIES MAKE EXCURSIONS AT SMALL COST ON THE STEAMERS OTHERS WILL TAKE THE TRAIN TO THE FRANKLIN AND NEWCASTLE OR CARBON RIVER COAL MINES FOR THE SAKE OF THE THIRTY OR FORTY MILE RIDES THROUGH THE WOODS
4397-15678-0028.flac,AND A LOOK INTO THE BLACK DEPTHS OF THE UNDERWORLD OTHERS AGAIN TAKE THE STEAMERS FOR VICTORIA FRASER RIVER OR VANCOUVER THE NEW AMBITIOUS TOWN AT THE TERMINUS OF THE CANADIAN RAILROAD THUS GETTING VIEWS OF THE OUTER WORLD IN A NEAR FOREIGN COUNTRY
4397-15678-0029.flac,GREEN RIVER IS A SMALL ROCKY STREAM WITH PICTURESQUE BANKS AND DERIVES ITS NAME FROM THE BEAUTIFUL PALE GREEN HUE OF ITS WATERS AMONG THE MOST INTERESTING OF ALL THE SUMMER REST AND PLEASURE PLACES IS THE FAMOUS HOP RANCH ON THE UPPER SNOQUALMIE RIVER
4397-15678-0030.flac,THIRTY OR FORTY MILES EASTWARD FROM SEATTLE
4397-15678-0031.flac,HALF PRAIRIE LEVEL AND FERTILE AND BEAUTIFULLY DIVERSIFIED WITH OUTSTANDING GROVES OF SPRUCES AND ALDERS AND RICH FLOWERY FRINGES OF SPIRAEA AND WILD ROSES THE RIVER MEANDERING DEEP AND TRANQUIL THROUGH THE MIDST OF IT
4397-15678-0032.flac,ON THE PORTIONS MOST EASILY CLEARED SOME THREE HUNDRED ACRES OF HOP VINES HAVE BEEN PLANTED AND ARE NOW IN FULL BEARING YIELDING IT IS SAID AT THE RATE OF ABOUT A TON OF HOPS TO THE ACRE THEY ARE A BEAUTIFUL CROP THESE VINES OF THE NORTH
4397-15678-0033.flac,PILLARS OF VERDURE IN REGULAR ROWS SEVEN FEET APART AND EIGHT OR TEN FEET IN HEIGHT THE LONG VIGOROUS SHOOTS SWEEPING ROUND IN FINE WILD FREEDOM AND THE LIGHT LEAFY CONES HANGING IN LOOSE HANDSOME CLUSTERS PERHAPS ENOUGH OF HOPS
4397-15678-0034.flac,MIGHT BE RAISED IN WASHINGTON FOR THE WANTS OF ALL THE WORLD BUT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND PICKERS TO HANDLE THE CROP MOST OF THE PICKING IS DONE BY INDIANS AND TO THIS FINE CLEAN PROFITABLE WORK THEY COME IN GREAT NUMBERS IN THEIR CANOES OLD AND YOUNG
4397-15678-0035.flac,STILL MORE STRIKING ARE THEIR QUEER CAMPS ON THE EDGES OF THE FIELDS OR OVER ON THE RIVER BANK WITH THE FIRELIGHT SHINING ON THEIR WILD JOLLY FACES BUT WOE TO THE RANCH SHOULD FIRE WATER GET THERE BUT THE CHIEF ATTRACTIONS HERE ARE NOT FOUND IN THE HOPS
4397-15678-0036.flac,BUT IN TROUT FISHING AND BEAR HUNTING AND IN THE TWO FINE FALLS ON THE RIVER FORMERLY THE TRIP FROM SEATTLE WAS A HARD ONE OVER CORDUROY ROADS NOW IT IS REACHED IN A FEW HOURS BY RAIL ALONG THE SHORES OF LAKE WASHINGTON AND LAKE SQUAK
4397-15678-0037.flac,AND FINE VIEWS OF THE FALL MAY BE HAD ON THAT SIDE BOTH FROM ABOVE AND BELOW IT IS SITUATED ON THE MAIN RIVER WHERE IT PLUNGES OVER A SHEER PRECIPICE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET HIGH IN LEAVING THE LEVEL MEADOWS OF THE ANCIENT LAKE BASIN
4397-15678-0038.flac,THE POOL IS OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH AS IS SHOWN BY THE RADIATING WELL BEATEN FOAM AND MIST WHICH IS OF A BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR AT TIMES OF EXQUISITE FINENESS OF TONE AND BY THE HEAVY WAVES THAT LASH THE ROCKS IN FRONT OF IT
4397-15678-0039.flac,SET IN A ROMANTIC DELL THATCHED WITH DRIPPING MOSSES AND FERNS AND EMBOWERED IN DENSE EVERGREENS AND BLOOMING BUSHES
4397-15678-0040.flac,THE ROAD LEADS THROUGH MAJESTIC WOODS WITH FERNS TEN FEET HIGH BENEATH SOME OF THE THICKETS AND ACROSS A GRAVELLY PLAIN DEFORESTED BY FIRE MANY YEARS AGO ORANGE LILIES ARE PLENTIFUL
4397-15678-0041.flac,AND HANDSOME SHINING MATS OF THE KINNIKINIC SPRINKLED WITH BRIGHT SCARLET BERRIES FROM A PLACE CALLED HUNT'S AT THE END OF THE WAGON ROAD A TRAIL LEADS THROUGH LUSH DRIPPING WOODS NEVER DRY
4397-15678-0042.flac,WHERE NEVER A DUST PARTICLE FLOATED AND WHERE ALL THE FLOWERS FRESH WITH MIST AND SPRAY ARE WETTER THAN WATER LILIES THE POOL AT THE FOOT OF THE FALL IS A PLACE SURPASSINGLY LOVELY TO LOOK AT WITH THE ENTHUSIASTIC RUSH AND SONG OF THE FALLS
4397-15678-0043.flac,THE MAJESTIC TREES OVERHEAD LEANING OVER THE BRINK LIKE LISTENERS EAGER TO CATCH EVERY WORD OF THE WHITE REFRESHING WATERS
4397-15666-0000.flac,THE GREATER PORTION OF THE CALENDAR SPRINGTIME OF UTAH HAS BEEN WINTER IN ALL THE UPPER CANYONS OF THE MOUNTAINS THE SNOW IS NOW FROM FIVE TO TEN FEET DEEP OR MORE AND MOST OF IT HAS FALLEN SINCE MARCH
4397-15666-0001.flac,ALMOST EVERY OTHER DAY DURING THE LAST THREE WEEKS SMALL LOCAL STORMS HAVE BEEN FALLING ON THE WAHSATCH AND OQUIRRH MOUNTAINS WHILE THE JORDAN VALLEY REMAINED DRY AND SUN FILLED BUT ON THE AFTERNOON OF THURSDAY THE SEVENTEENTH ULTIMO
4397-15666-0002.flac,WIND RAIN AND SNOW FILLED THE WHOLE BASIN DRIVING WILDLY OVER VALLEY AND PLAIN FROM RANGE TO RANGE BESTOWING THEIR BENEFACTIONS IN MOST CORDIAL AND HARMONIOUS STORM MEASURES
4397-15666-0003.flac,WITH BILLOWS OF DUST AND SAND
4397-15666-0004.flac,THE BEGINNING OF THE OUTPOURING OF THE TREASURED WRATH OF THE LORD UPON THE GENTILES FOR THE KILLING OF JOSEPH SMITH TO ME IT SEEMED A CORDIAL OUTPOURING OF NATURE'S LOVE BUT IT IS EASY TO DIFFER WITH SALT LATTER DAYS IN EVERYTHING STORMS WIVES
4397-15666-0005.flac,POLITICS AND RELIGION ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE STORM REACHED THE CITY I WAS SO FORTUNATE AS TO BE OUT WITH A FRIEND ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN ENJOYING THE SCENERY CLOUDS WITH PECULIARLY RESTLESS AND SELF CONSCIOUS GESTURES
4397-15666-0006.flac,WERE MARSHALING THEMSELVES ALONG THE MOUNTAIN TOPS AND SENDING OUT LONG OVERLAPPING WINGS ACROSS THE VALLEY AND EVEN WHERE NO CLOUD WAS VISIBLE AN OBSCURING FILM ABSORBED THE SUNLIGHT GIVING RISE TO A COLD BLUISH DARKNESS NEVERTHELESS
4397-15666-0007.flac,AND THEIR MARVELOUS PROFUSION OF ORNATE SCULPTURE WERE MOST IMPRESSIVELY MANIFEST ONE WOULD FANCY THAT A MAN MIGHT BE CLEARLY SEEN WALKING ON THE SNOW AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES WHILE WE WERE REVELING IN THIS RARE UNGARISH GRANDEUR
4397-15666-0008.flac,TURNING FROM RANGE TO RANGE STUDYING THE DARKENING SKY AND LISTENING TO THE STILL SMALL VOICES OF THE FLOWERS AT OUR FEET SOME OF THE DENSER CLOUDS CAME DOWN CROWNING AND WREATHING THE HIGHEST PEAKS AND DROPPING LONG GRAY FRINGES
4397-15666-0009.flac,WHOSE SMOOTH LINEAR STRUCTURE SHOWED THAT SNOW WAS BEGINNING TO FALL OF THESE PARTIAL STORMS THERE WERE SOON TEN OR TWELVE ARRANGED IN TWO ROWS WHILE THE MAIN JORDAN VALLEY BETWEEN THEM LAY AS YET IN PROFOUND CALM AT FOUR THIRTY P M
4397-15666-0010.flac,A DARK BROWNISH CLOUD APPEARED CLOSE DOWN ON THE PLAIN TOWARDS THE LAKE EXTENDING FROM THE NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE OQUIRRH RANGE IN A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH ITS PECULIAR COLOR AND STRUCTURE
4397-15666-0011.flac,EXCITED OUR ATTENTION WITHOUT ENABLING US TO DECIDE CERTAINLY AS TO ITS CHARACTER BUT WE WERE NOT LEFT LONG IN DOUBT FOR IN A FEW MINUTES IT CAME SWEEPING OVER THE VALLEY IN A WILD UPROAR A TORRENT OF WIND THICK WITH SAND AND DUST
4397-15666-0012.flac,ADVANCING WITH A MOST MAJESTIC FRONT ROLLING AND OVERCOMBING LIKE A GIGANTIC SEA WAVE SCARCELY WAS IT IN PLAIN SIGHT ERE IT WAS UPON US RACING ACROSS THE JORDAN OVER THE CITY
4397-15666-0013.flac,AND UP THE SLOPES OF THE WAHSATCH ECLIPSING ALL THE LANDSCAPES IN ITS COURSE THE BENDING TREES THE DUST STREAMERS AND THE WILD ONRUSH OF EVERYTHING MOVABLE GIVING IT AN APPRECIABLE VISIBILITY THAT RENDERED IT GRAND AND INSPIRING
4397-15666-0014.flac,THE CRYSTAL FLAKES FALLING IN THE FOUL STREETS WAS A PITIFUL SIGHT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VAUNTED REFINING INFLUENCES OF TOWNS PURITY OF ALL KINDS PURE HEARTS PURE STREAMS PURE SNOW
4397-15666-0015.flac,MUST HERE BE EXPOSED TO TERRIBLE TRIALS CITY CREEK COMING FROM ITS HIGH GLACIAL FOUNTAINS ENTERS THE STREETS OF THIS MORMON ZION PURE AS AN ANGEL BUT HOW DOES IT LEAVE IT
4397-15666-0016.flac,EVEN ROSES AND LILIES IN GARDENS MOST LOVED ARE TAINTED WITH A THOUSAND IMPURITIES AS SOON AS THEY UNFOLD I HEARD BRIGHAM YOUNG IN THE TABERNACLE THE OTHER DAY WARNING HIS PEOPLE THAT IF THEY DID NOT MEND THEIR MANNERS ANGELS WOULD NOT COME INTO THEIR HOUSES
4397-15666-0017.flac,THOUGH PERCHANCE THEY MIGHT BE SAUNTERING BY WITH LITTLE ELSE TO DO THAN CHAT WITH THEM POSSIBLY THERE MAY BE SALT LAKE FAMILIES SUFFICIENTLY PURE FOR ANGEL SOCIETY BUT I WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THE RECEPTION THEY GAVE THE SMALL SNOW ANGELS THAT GOD SENT AMONG THEM THE OTHER NIGHT
4397-15666-0018.flac,ONLY THE CHILDREN HAILED THEM WITH DELIGHT THE OLD LATTER DAYS SEEMED TO SHUN THEM I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW MISTER YOUNG THE LAKE PROPHET WOULD MEET SUCH MESSENGERS BUT TO RETURN TO THE STORM
4397-15666-0019.flac,TOWARD THE EVENING OF THE EIGHTEENTH IT BEGAN TO WITHER THE SNOWY SKIRTS OF THE WAHSATCH MOUNTAINS APPEARED BENEATH THE LIFTING FRINGES OF THE CLOUDS AND THE SUN SHONE OUT THROUGH COLORED WINDOWS PRODUCING ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS AFTER STORM EFFECTS I EVER WITNESSED
4397-15666-0020.flac,LOOKING ACROSS THE JORDAN THE GRAY SAGEY SLOPES FROM THE BASE OF THE OQUIRRH MOUNTAINS WERE COVERED WITH A THICK PLUSHY CLOTH OF GOLD SOFT AND ETHEREAL AS A CLOUD NOT MERELY TINTED AND GILDED LIKE A ROCK WITH AUTUMN SUNSHINE BUT DEEPLY MUFFLED BEYOND RECOGNITION
4397-15666-0021.flac,SURELY NOTHING IN HEAVEN NOR ANY MANSION OF THE LORD IN ALL HIS WORLDS COULD BE MORE GLORIOUSLY CARPETED OTHER PORTIONS OF THE PLAIN WERE FLUSHED WITH RED AND PURPLE AND ALL THE MOUNTAINS AND THE CLOUDS ABOVE THEM WERE PAINTED IN CORRESPONDING LOVELINESS
4397-15666-0022.flac,EARTH AND SKY ROUND AND ROUND THE ENTIRE LANDSCAPE WAS ONE RAVISHING REVELATION OF COLOR INFINITELY VARIED AND INTERBLENDED I HAVE SEEN MANY A GLORIOUS SUNSET BENEATH LIFTING STORM CLOUDS ON THE MOUNTAINS
4397-15666-0023.flac,BUT NOTHING COMPARABLE WITH THIS I FELT AS IF NEW ARRIVED IN SOME OTHER FAR OFF WORLD THE MOUNTAINS THE PLAINS THE SKY ALL SEEMED NEW OTHER EXPERIENCES SEEMED BUT TO HAVE PREPARED ME FOR THIS AS SOULS ARE PREPARED FOR HEAVEN
4397-15666-0024.flac,TRAILED THEIR LUSTROUS FRINGES THROUGH THE PINES AS IF TAKING A LAST VIEW OF THEIR ACCOMPLISHED WORK THEN CAME DARKNESS AND THE GLORIOUS DAY WAS DONE
4397-15666-0025.flac,THEY ARE COVERED WITH COMMON SUNSHINE DOWN HERE ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN LARKS AND REDWINGS ARE SWINGING ON THE RUSHES THE BALMY AIR IS INSTINCT WITH IMMORTAL LIFE THE WILD FLOWERS THE GRASS
4397-15666-0026.flac,AND THE FARMERS GRAIN ARE FRESH AS IF LIKE THE SNOW THEY HAD COME OUT OF HEAVEN
2893-139310-0000.flac,THE PEOPLE MARCH HE BECAME AWARE OF SOMEONE URGING A GLASS OF CLEAR FLUID UPON HIS ATTENTION LOOKED UP AND DISCOVERED THIS WAS A DARK YOUNG MAN IN A YELLOW GARMENT HE TOOK THE DOSE FORTHWITH AND IN A MOMENT HE WAS GLOWING
2893-139310-0001.flac,A TALL MAN IN A BLACK ROBE STOOD BY HIS SHOULDER AND POINTED TO THE HALF OPEN DOOR INTO THE HALL THIS MAN WAS SHOUTING CLOSE TO HIS EAR AND YET WHAT WAS SAID WAS INDISTINCT BECAUSE OF THE TREMENDOUS UPROAR FROM THE GREAT THEATRE
2893-139310-0002.flac,BEHIND THE MAN WAS A GIRL IN A SILVERY GREY ROBE WHOM GRAHAM EVEN IN THIS CONFUSION PERCEIVED TO BE BEAUTIFUL HER DARK EYES FULL OF WONDER AND CURIOSITY WERE FIXED ON HIM HER LIPS TREMBLED APART
2893-139310-0003.flac,A PARTIALLY OPENED DOOR GAVE A GLIMPSE OF THE CROWDED HALL AND ADMITTED A VAST UNEVEN TUMULT A HAMMERING CLAPPING AND SHOUTING THAT DIED AWAY AND BEGAN AGAIN AND ROSE TO A THUNDEROUS PITCH
2893-139310-0004.flac,AND SO CONTINUED INTERMITTENTLY ALL THE TIME THAT GRAHAM REMAINED IN THE LITTLE ROOM HE WATCHED THE LIPS OF THE MAN IN BLACK AND GATHERED THAT HE WAS MAKING SOME EXPLANATION HE STARED STUPIDLY FOR SOME MOMENTS AT THESE THINGS AND THEN STOOD UP ABRUPTLY
2893-139310-0005.flac,HE GRASPED THE ARM OF THIS SHOUTING PERSON TELL ME HE CRIED WHO AM I WHO AM I THE OTHERS CAME NEARER TO HEAR HIS WORDS
2893-139310-0006.flac,HIS EYES SEARCHED THEIR FACES THEY HAVE TOLD HIM NOTHING CRIED THE GIRL TELL ME TELL ME CRIED GRAHAM YOU ARE THE MASTER OF THE EARTH YOU ARE OWNER OF THE WORLD
2893-139310-0007.flac,HE DID NOT BELIEVE HE HEARD ARIGHT HE RESISTED THE PERSUASION HE PRETENDED NOT TO UNDERSTAND NOT TO HEAR HE LIFTED HIS VOICE AGAIN I HAVE BEEN AWAKE THREE DAYS A PRISONER THREE DAYS
2893-139310-0008.flac,IT IS LONDON YES SAID THE YOUNGER MAN AND THOSE WHO MEET IN THE GREAT HALL WITH THE WHITE ATLAS HOW DOES IT CONCERN ME
2893-139310-0009.flac,COUNCILLORS UNDER THE ATLAS WHY SHOULD THEY TRY TO DRUG ME TO KEEP YOU INSENSIBLE SAID THE MAN IN YELLOW TO PREVENT YOUR INTERFERENCE
2893-139310-0010.flac,BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ATLAS SIRE SAID THE MAN IN YELLOW THE WORLD IS ON YOUR SHOULDERS THEY RULE IT IN YOUR NAME THE SOUNDS FROM THE HALL HAD DIED INTO A SILENCE
2893-139310-0011.flac,THREADED BY ONE MONOTONOUS VOICE NOW SUDDENLY TRAMPLING ON THESE LAST WORDS CAME A DEAFENING TUMULT A ROARING AND THUNDERING CHEER CROWDED ON CHEER VOICES HOARSE AND SHRILL BEATING OVERLAPPING AND WHILE IT LASTED
2893-139310-0012.flac,THE PEOPLE IN THE LITTLE ROOM COULD NOT HEAR EACH OTHER SHOUT GRAHAM STOOD HIS INTELLIGENCE CLINGING HELPLESSLY TO THE THING HE HAD JUST HEARD THE COUNCIL HE REPEATED BLANKLY AND THEN SNATCHED AT A NAME THAT HAD STRUCK HIM
2893-139310-0013.flac,BUT WHO IS OSTROG HE SAID

2893-139310-0036.flac,HE EMERGED IN THE ALCOVE AGAIN INCONTINENTLY THE MOUNTING WAVES OF THE SONG BROKE UPON HIS APPEARING AND FLASHED UP INTO A FOAM OF SHOUTING GUIDED BY LINCOLN'S HAND HE MARCHED OBLIQUELY ACROSS THE CENTRE OF THE STAGE FACING THE PEOPLE
2893-139310-0037.flac,THE HALL WAS A VAST AND INTRICATE SPACE GALLERIES BALCONIES BROAD SPACES OF AMPHITHEATRAL STEPS AND GREAT ARCHWAYS FAR AWAY HIGH UP SEEMED THE MOUTH OF A HUGE PASSAGE FULL OF STRUGGLING HUMANITY
2893-139310-0038.flac,THE WHOLE MULTITUDE WAS SWAYING IN CONGESTED MASSES INDIVIDUAL FIGURES SPRANG OUT OF THE TUMULT IMPRESSED HIM MOMENTARILY AND LOST DEFINITION AGAIN CLOSE TO THE PLATFORM SWAYED A BEAUTIFUL FAIR WOMAN CARRIED BY THREE MEN

2893-139310-0048.flac,TRIBUTARY GANGWAYS FROM THE REMOTE UPLANDS OF THE HALL THRUST DOWNWARD IN AN INCESSANT REPLACEMENT OF PEOPLE TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP THE UNISON OF THE SONG WAS ENRICHED AND COMPLICATED BY THE MASSIVE ECHOES OF ARCHES AND PASSAGES MEN AND WOMEN

2893-139310-0050.flac,AT LINCOLN'S PRESSURE HE TURNED TOWARDS THE ARCHWAY WALKING UNCONSCIOUSLY IN THAT RHYTHM SCARCELY NOTICING HIS MOVEMENT FOR THE MELODY AND STIR OF IT THE MULTITUDE THE GESTURE AND SONG ALL MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION
2893-139310-0051.flac,THE FLOW OF PEOPLE SMOTE DOWNWARD UNTIL THE UPTURNED FACES WERE BELOW THE LEVEL OF HIS FEET HE WAS AWARE OF A PATH BEFORE HIM OF A SUITE ABOUT HIM OF GUARDS AND DIGNITIES AND LINCOLN ON HIS RIGHT HAND
2893-139310-0052.flac,ATTENDANTS INTERVENED AND EVER AND AGAIN BLOTTED OUT THE SIGHT OF THE MULTITUDE TO THE LEFT BEFORE HIM WENT THE BACKS OF THE GUARDS IN BLACK THREE AND THREE AND THREE HE WAS MARCHED ALONG A LITTLE RAILED WAY AND CROSSED ABOVE THE ARCHWAY
2893-139310-0053.flac,WITH THE TORRENT DIPPING TO FLOW BENEATH AND SHOUTING UP TO HIM HE DID NOT KNOW WHITHER HE WENT HE DID NOT WANT TO KNOW HE GLANCED BACK ACROSS A FLAMING SPACIOUSNESS OF HALL
2893-139322-0000.flac,CHAPTER TWENTY ONE THE UNDER SIDE FROM THE BUSINESS QUARTER THEY PRESENTLY PASSED BY THE RUNNING WAYS INTO A REMOTE QUARTER OF THE CITY WHERE THE BULK OF THE MANUFACTURES WAS DONE
2893-139322-0001.flac,ON THEIR WAY THE PLATFORMS CROSSED THE THAMES TWICE AND PASSED IN A BROAD VIADUCT ACROSS ONE OF THE GREAT ROADS THAT ENTERED THE CITY FROM THE NORTH IN BOTH CASES HIS IMPRESSION WAS SWIFT AND IN BOTH VERY VIVID
2893-139322-0002.flac,THE RIVER WAS A BROAD WRINKLED GLITTER OF BLACK SEA WATER OVERARCHED BY BUILDINGS AND VANISHING EITHER WAY INTO A BLACKNESS STARRED WITH RECEDING LIGHTS A STRING OF BLACK BARGES PASSED SEAWARD MANNED BY BLUE CLAD MEN
2893-139322-0003.flac,THE ROAD WAS A LONG AND VERY BROAD AND HIGH TUNNEL ALONG WHICH BIG WHEELED MACHINES DROVE NOISELESSLY AND SWIFTLY HERE TOO THE DISTINCTIVE BLUE OF THE LABOUR DEPARTMENT WAS IN ABUNDANCE THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE DOUBLE TRACKS
2893-139322-0004.flac,STRUCK GRAHAM MOST VIVIDLY ONE LANK AND VERY HIGH CARRIAGE WITH LONGITUDINAL METALLIC RODS HUNG WITH THE DRIPPING CARCASSES OF MANY HUNDRED SHEEP ARRESTED HIS ATTENTION UNDULY ABRUPTLY THE EDGE OF THE ARCHWAY CUT
2893-139322-0005.flac,AND BLOTTED OUT THE PICTURE PRESENTLY THEY LEFT THE WAY AND DESCENDED BY A LIFT AND TRAVERSED A PASSAGE THAT SLOPED DOWNWARD AND SO CAME TO A DESCENDING LIFT AGAIN THE APPEARANCE OF THINGS CHANGED EVEN THE PRETENCE OF ARCHITECTURAL ORNAMENT DISAPPEARED
2893-139322-0006.flac,THE LIGHTS DIMINISHED IN NUMBER AND SIZE THE ARCHITECTURE BECAME MORE AND MORE MASSIVE IN PROPORTION TO THE SPACES AS THE FACTORY QUARTERS WERE REACHED AND IN THE DUSTY BISCUIT MAKING PLACE OF THE POTTERS AMONG THE FELSPAR MILLS IN THE FURNACE ROOMS OF THE METAL WORKERS
2893-139322-0007.flac,THE BLUE CANVAS CLOTHING WAS ON MAN WOMAN AND CHILD MANY OF THESE GREAT AND DUSTY GALLERIES WERE SILENT AVENUES OF MACHINERY ENDLESS RAKED OUT ASHEN FURNACES TESTIFIED TO THE REVOLUTIONARY DISLOCATION
2893-139322-0008.flac,BUT WHEREVER THERE WAS WORK IT WAS BEING DONE BY SLOW MOVING WORKERS IN BLUE CANVAS THE ONLY PEOPLE NOT IN BLUE CANVAS WERE THE OVERLOOKERS OF THE WORK PLACES AND THE ORANGE CLAD LABOUR POLICE AND FRESH FROM THE FLUSHED FACES OF THE DANCING HALLS
2893-139322-0009.flac,THE VOLUNTARY VIGOURS OF THE BUSINESS QUARTER GRAHAM COULD NOTE THE PINCHED FACES THE FEEBLE MUSCLES AND WEARY EYES OF MANY OF THE LATTER DAY WORKERS SUCH AS HE SAW AT WORK WERE NOTICEABLY INFERIOR IN PHYSIQUE TO THE FEW GAILY DRESSED MANAGERS AND FOREWOMEN
2893-139322-0010.flac,WHO WERE DIRECTING THEIR LABOURS THE BURLY LABOURERS OF THE OLD VICTORIAN TIMES HAD FOLLOWED THAT DRAY HORSE AND ALL SUCH LIVING FORCE PRODUCERS TO EXTINCTION THE PLACE OF HIS COSTLY MUSCLES WAS TAKEN BY SOME DEXTEROUS MACHINE
2893-139322-0011.flac,THE LATTER DAY LABOURER MALE AS WELL AS FEMALE WAS ESSENTIALLY A MACHINE MINDER AND FEEDER A SERVANT AND ATTENDANT OR AN ARTIST UNDER DIRECTION THE WOMEN IN COMPARISON WITH THOSE GRAHAM REMEMBERED
2893-139322-0012.flac,WERE AS A CLASS DISTINCTLY PLAIN AND FLAT CHESTED TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF EMANCIPATION FROM THE MORAL RESTRAINTS OF PURITANICAL RELIGION TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF CITY LIFE HAD DONE THEIR WORK IN ELIMINATING THE STRAIN OF FEMININE BEAUTY AND VIGOUR FROM THE BLUE CANVAS MYRIADS
2893-139322-0013.flac,TO BE BRILLIANT PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY TO BE IN ANY WAY ATTRACTIVE OR EXCEPTIONAL HAD BEEN AND WAS STILL A CERTAIN WAY OF EMANCIPATION TO THE DRUDGE A LINE OF ESCAPE TO THE PLEASURE CITY AND ITS SPLENDOURS AND DELIGHTS AND AT LAST
2893-139322-0014.flac,TO THE EUTHANASY AND PEACE TO BE STEADFAST AGAINST SUCH INDUCEMENTS WAS SCARCELY TO BE EXPECTED OF MEANLY NOURISHED SOULS IN THE YOUNG CITIES OF GRAHAM'S FORMER LIFE THE NEWLY AGGREGATED LABOURING MASS
2893-139322-0015.flac,HAD BEEN A DIVERSE MULTITUDE STILL STIRRED BY THE TRADITION OF PERSONAL HONOUR AND A HIGH MORALITY NOW IT WAS DIFFERENTIATING INTO AN INSTINCT CLASS WITH A MORAL AND PHYSICAL DIFFERENCE OF ITS OWN EVEN WITH A DIALECT OF ITS OWN
2893-139322-0016.flac,THEY PENETRATED DOWNWARD EVER DOWNWARD TOWARDS THE WORKING PLACES PRESENTLY THEY PASSED UNDERNEATH ONE OF THE STREETS OF THE MOVING WAYS AND SAW ITS PLATFORMS RUNNING ON THEIR RAILS FAR OVERHEAD AND CHINKS OF WHITE LIGHTS BETWEEN THE TRANSVERSE SLITS
2893-139322-0017.flac,THE FACTORIES THAT WERE NOT WORKING WERE SPARSELY LIGHTED TO GRAHAM THEY AND THEIR SHROUDED AISLES OF GIANT MACHINES SEEMED PLUNGED IN GLOOM AND EVEN WHERE WORK WAS GOING ON THE ILLUMINATION WAS FAR LESS BRILLIANT THAN UPON THE PUBLIC WAYS
2893-139322-0018.flac,HE CAME TO THE WARREN OF THE JEWELLERS AND WITH SOME DIFFICULTY AND BY USING HIS SIGNATURE OBTAINED ADMISSION TO THESE GALLERIES THEY WERE HIGH AND DARK AND RATHER COLD IN THE FIRST A FEW MEN WERE MAKING ORNAMENTS OF GOLD FILIGREE
2893-139322-0019.flac,EACH MAN AT A LITTLE BENCH BY HIMSELF AND WITH A LITTLE SHADED LIGHT THE LONG VISTA OF LIGHT PATCHES WITH THE NIMBLE FINGERS BRIGHTLY LIT AND MOVING AMONG THE GLEAMING YELLOW COILS AND THE INTENT FACE LIKE THE FACE OF A GHOST IN EACH SHADOW
2893-139322-0020.flac,HAD THE ODDEST EFFECT THE WORK WAS BEAUTIFULLY EXECUTED
2893-139322-0021.flac,FOR THE MOST PART INTRICATE GROTESQUES OR THE RINGING OF THE CHANGES ON A GEOMETRICAL MOTIF THESE WORKERS WORE A PECULIAR WHITE UNIFORM WITHOUT POCKETS OR SLEEVES THEY ASSUMED THIS ON COMING TO WORK BUT AT NIGHT
2893-139322-0022.flac,IN SPITE OF EVERY PRECAUTION THE LABOUR POLICEMAN TOLD THEM IN A DEPRESSED TONE THE DEPARTMENT WAS NOT INFREQUENTLY ROBBED BEYOND WAS A GALLERY OF WOMEN BUSIED IN CUTTING AND SETTING SLABS OF ARTIFICIAL RUBY
2893-139322-0023.flac,MANY OF THESE WORKERS HAD LIPS AND NOSTRILS A LIVID WHITE DUE TO A DISEASE CAUSED BY A PECULIAR PURPLE ENAMEL THAT CHANCED TO BE MUCH IN FASHION ASANO APOLOGISED TO GRAHAM FOR THIS OFFENSIVE SIGHT BUT EXCUSED HIMSELF ON THE SCORE OF THE CONVENIENCE OF THIS ROUTE
2893-139322-0024.flac,THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO SEE SAID GRAHAM THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO SEE TRYING TO AVOID A START AT A PARTICULARLY STRIKING DISFIGUREMENT SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER WITH HERSELF THAN THAT SAID ASANO
2893-139322-0025.flac,GRAHAM MADE SOME INDIGNANT COMMENTS BUT SIRE WE SIMPLY COULD NOT STAND THAT STUFF WITHOUT THE PURPLE SAID ASANO IN YOUR DAYS PEOPLE COULD STAND SUCH CRUDITIES THEY WERE NEARER THE BARBARIC BY TWO HUNDRED YEARS
2893-139322-0026.flac,AND CAME TO A LITTLE BRIDGE THAT SPANNED A VAULT LOOKING OVER THE PARAPET GRAHAM SAW THAT BENEATH WAS A WHARF UNDER YET MORE TREMENDOUS ARCHINGS THAN ANY HE HAD SEEN THREE BARGES SMOTHERED IN FLOURY DUST WERE BEING UNLOADED OF THEIR CARGOES OF POWDERED FELSPAR
2893-139322-0027.flac,BY A MULTITUDE OF COUGHING MEN EACH GUIDING A LITTLE TRUCK THE DUST FILLED THE PLACE WITH A CHOKING MIST AND TURNED THE ELECTRIC GLARE YELLOW THE VAGUE SHADOWS OF THESE WORKERS GESTICULATED ABOUT THEIR FEET AND RUSHED TO AND FRO AGAINST A LONG STRETCH OF WHITE WASHED WALL
2893-139322-0028.flac,EVERY NOW AND THEN ONE WOULD STOP TO COUGH A SHADOWY HUGE MASS OF MASONRY RISING OUT OF THE INKY WATER BROUGHT TO GRAHAM'S MIND THE THOUGHT OF THE MULTITUDE OF WAYS AND GALLERIES AND LIFTS THAT ROSE FLOOR ABOVE FLOOR OVERHEAD BETWEEN HIM AND THE SKY
2893-139322-0029.flac,THEIR FEET MADE A HOLLOW THUNDER ON THE PLANKS ALONG WHICH THEY WENT TO AND FRO AND AS HE LOOKED AT THIS SCENE SOME HIDDEN VOICE IN THE DARKNESS BEGAN TO SING STOP THAT SHOUTED ONE OF THE POLICEMEN BUT THE ORDER WAS DISOBEYED
2893-139322-0030.flac,AND FIRST ONE AND THEN ALL THE WHITE STAINED MEN WHO WERE WORKING THERE HAD TAKEN UP THE BEATING REFRAIN SINGING IT DEFIANTLY THE SONG OF THE REVOLT THE FEET UPON THE PLANKS THUNDERED NOW TO THE RHYTHM OF THE SONG TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP
2893-139322-0031.flac,THE POLICEMAN WHO HAD SHOUTED GLANCED AT HIS FELLOW AND GRAHAM SAW HIM SHRUG HIS SHOULDERS HE MADE NO FURTHER EFFORT TO STOP THE SINGING AND SO THEY WENT THROUGH THESE FACTORIES AND PLACES OF TOIL SEEING MANY PAINFUL AND GRIM THINGS
2893-139322-0032.flac,THAT WALK LEFT ON GRAHAM'S MIND A MAZE OF MEMORIES FLUCTUATING PICTURES OF SWATHED HALLS AND CROWDED VAULTS SEEN THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST OF INTRICATE MACHINES THE RACING THREADS OF LOOMS THE HEAVY BEAT OF STAMPING MACHINERY
2893-139322-0033.flac,THE ROAR AND RATTLE OF BELT AND ARMATURE OF ILL LIT SUBTERRANEAN AISLES OF SLEEPING PLACES ILLIMITABLE VISTAS OF PIN POINT LIGHTS HERE WAS THE SMELL OF TANNING AND HERE THE REEK OF A BREWERY
2893-139322-0034.flac,AND HERE UNPRECEDENTED REEKS EVERYWHERE WERE PILLARS AND CROSS ARCHINGS OF SUCH A MASSIVENESS AS GRAHAM HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN THICK TITANS OF GREASY SHINING BRICKWORK CRUSHED BENEATH THE VAST WEIGHT OF THAT COMPLEX CITY WORLD
2893-139322-0035.flac,EVEN AS THESE ANEMIC MILLIONS WERE CRUSHED BY ITS COMPLEXITY AND EVERYWHERE WERE PALE FEATURES LEAN LIMBS DISFIGUREMENT AND DEGRADATION ONCE AND AGAIN AND AGAIN A THIRD TIME
2893-139322-0036.flac,GRAHAM HEARD THE SONG OF THE REVOLT DURING HIS LONG UNPLEASANT RESEARCH IN THESE PLACES AND ONCE HE SAW A CONFUSED STRUGGLE DOWN A PASSAGE AND LEARNT THAT A NUMBER OF THESE SERFS HAD SEIZED THEIR BREAD BEFORE THEIR WORK WAS DONE GRAHAM WAS ASCENDING TOWARDS THE WAYS AGAIN
2893-139322-0037.flac,WHEN HE SAW A NUMBER OF BLUE CLAD CHILDREN RUNNING DOWN A TRANSVERSE PASSAGE AND PRESENTLY PERCEIVED THE REASON OF THEIR PANIC IN A COMPANY OF THE LABOUR POLICE ARMED WITH CLUBS TROTTING TOWARDS SOME UNKNOWN DISTURBANCE AND THEN CAME A REMOTE DISORDER
2893-139322-0038.flac,BUT FOR THE MOST PART THIS REMNANT THAT WORKED WORKED HOPELESSLY ALL THE SPIRIT THAT WAS LEFT IN FALLEN HUMANITY WAS ABOVE IN THE STREETS THAT NIGHT CALLING FOR THE MASTER AND VALIANTLY AND NOISILY KEEPING ITS ARMS
2893-139322-0039.flac,THEY EMERGED FROM THESE WANDERINGS AND STOOD BLINKING IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MIDDLE PASSAGE OF THE PLATFORMS AGAIN THEY BECAME AWARE OF THE REMOTE HOOTING AND YELPING OF THE MACHINES OF ONE OF THE GENERAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICES
2893-139322-0040.flac,THEN A WOMAN WITH A FACE OF MUTE WHITE TERROR AND ANOTHER WHO GASPED AND SHRIEKED AS SHE RAN WHAT HAS HAPPENED NOW SAID GRAHAM PUZZLED FOR HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR THICK SPEECH THEN HE HEARD IT IN ENGLISH AND PERCEIVED THAT THE THING THAT EVERYONE WAS SHOUTING
2893-139322-0041.flac,THAT MEN YELLED TO ONE ANOTHER THAT WOMEN TOOK UP SCREAMING THAT WAS PASSING LIKE THE FIRST BREEZE OF A THUNDERSTORM CHILL AND SUDDEN THROUGH THE CITY WAS THIS OSTROG HAS ORDERED THE BLACK POLICE TO LONDON THE BLACK POLICE ARE COMING FROM SOUTH AFRICA THE BLACK POLICE THE BLACK POLICE
2893-139322-0042.flac,HE HESITATED LOOKED AT GRAHAM'S FACE AND TOLD HIM THE THING HE ALREADY KNEW BUT HOW CAN THEY KNOW ASKED ASANO GRAHAM HEARD SOMEONE SHOUTING STOP ALL WORK STOP ALL WORK
2893-139322-0043.flac,AND A SWARTHY HUNCHBACK RIDICULOUSLY GAY IN GREEN AND GOLD CAME LEAPING DOWN THE PLATFORMS TOWARD HIM BAWLING AGAIN AND AGAIN IN GOOD ENGLISH THIS IS OSTROG'S DOING OSTROG THE KNAVE THE MASTER IS BETRAYED HIS VOICE WAS HOARSE
2893-139322-0044.flac,HE YELLED AN UNSPEAKABLE HORROR THAT THE BLACK POLICE HAD DONE IN PARIS AND SO PASSED SHRIEKING OSTROG THE KNAVE FOR A MOMENT GRAHAM STOOD STILL FOR IT HAD COME UPON HIM AGAIN THAT THESE THINGS WERE A DREAM
2893-139322-0045.flac,HE LOOKED UP AT THE GREAT CLIFF OF BUILDINGS ON EITHER SIDE VANISHING INTO BLUE HAZE AT LAST ABOVE THE LIGHTS AND DOWN TO THE ROARING TIERS OF PLATFORMS AND THE SHOUTING RUNNING PEOPLE WHO WERE GESTICULATING PAST
2893-139322-0046.flac,THE MASTER IS BETRAYED THEY CRIED THE MASTER IS BETRAYED SUDDENLY THE SITUATION SHAPED ITSELF IN HIS MIND REAL AND URGENT
2893-139322-0047.flac,HE SAID I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THE HOUR HAS COME HE THOUGHT SWIFTLY WHAT AM I TO DO GO BACK TO THE COUNCIL HOUSE SAID ASANO WHY SHOULD I NOT APPEAL THE PEOPLE ARE HERE
2893-139322-0048.flac,YOU WILL LOSE TIME THEY WILL DOUBT IF IT IS YOU BUT THEY WILL MASS ABOUT THE COUNCIL HOUSE THERE YOU WILL FIND THEIR LEADERS YOUR STRENGTH IS THERE WITH THEM SUPPOSE THIS IS ONLY A RUMOUR
2893-139322-0049.flac,IT SOUNDS TRUE SAID ASANO LET US HAVE THE FACTS SAID GRAHAM
2893-139322-0050.flac,EVEN NOW THE RUINS MAY BE IMPASSABLE GRAHAM REGARDED HIM DOUBTFULLY AND FOLLOWED HIM THEY WENT UP THE STEPPED PLATFORMS TO THE SWIFTEST ONE AND THERE ASANO ACCOSTED A LABOURER THE ANSWERS TO HIS QUESTIONS WERE IN THE THICK VULGAR SPEECH WHAT DID HE SAY ASKED GRAHAM
2893-139322-0051.flac,HAD NOT SOMEONE IN THE WIND VANE OFFICES LEARNT HE SAID A GIRL A GIRL NOT HE SAID A GIRL HE DID NOT KNOW WHO SHE WAS WHO CAME OUT FROM THE COUNCIL HOUSE CRYING ALOUD AND TOLD THE MEN AT WORK AMONG THE RUINS
2893-139322-0052.flac,AND THEN ANOTHER THING WAS SHOUTED SOMETHING THAT TURNED AN AIMLESS TUMULT INTO DETERMINATE MOVEMENTS IT CAME LIKE A WIND ALONG THE STREET
2391-145015-0000.flac,STEVENTON IS A SMALL RURAL VILLAGE UPON THE CHALK HILLS OF NORTH HANTS SITUATED IN A WINDING VALLEY ABOUT SEVEN MILES FROM BASINGSTOKE THE SOUTH WESTERN RAILWAY CROSSES IT BY A SHORT EMBANKMENT
2391-145015-0001.flac,AND AS IT CURVES ROUND PRESENTS A GOOD VIEW OF IT ON THE LEFT HAND TO THOSE WHO ARE TRAVELLING DOWN THE LINE ABOUT THREE MILES BEFORE ENTERING THE TUNNEL UNDER POPHAM BEACON IT MAY BE KNOWN TO SOME SPORTSMEN AS LYING IN ONE OF THE BEST PORTIONS OF THE VINE HUNT
2391-145015-0002.flac,IT IS CERTAINLY NOT A PICTURESQUE COUNTRY IT PRESENTS NO GRAND OR EXTENSIVE VIEWS BUT THE FEATURES ARE SMALL RATHER THAN PLAIN THE SURFACE CONTINUALLY SWELLS AND SINKS BUT THE HILLS ARE NOT BOLD NOR THE VALLEYS DEEP
2391-145015-0003.flac,AND THOUGH IT IS SUFFICIENTLY WELL CLOTHED WITH WOODS AND HEDGEROWS YET THE POVERTY OF THE SOIL IN MOST PLACES PREVENTS THE TIMBER FROM ATTAINING A LARGE SIZE STILL IT HAS ITS BEAUTIES THE LANES WIND ALONG IN A NATURAL CURVE
2391-145015-0004.flac,CONTINUALLY FRINGED WITH IRREGULAR BORDERS OF NATIVE TURF AND LEAD TO PLEASANT NOOKS AND CORNERS ONE WHO KNEW AND LOVED IT WELL VERY HAPPILY EXPRESSED ITS QUIET CHARMS WHEN HE WROTE TRUE TASTE IS NOT FASTIDIOUS
2391-145015-0005.flac,NOR REJECTS BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT COME WITHIN THE RULE OF COMPOSITION PURE AND PICTURESQUE UNNUMBERED SIMPLE SCENES WHICH FILL THE LEAVES OF NATURE'S SKETCH BOOK OF THIS SOMEWHAT TAME COUNTRY STEVENTON FROM THE FALL OF THE GROUND AND THE ABUNDANCE OF ITS TIMBER
2391-145015-0006.flac,IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE PRETTIEST SPOTS
2391-145015-0007.flac,COMPARED WITH THE BROAD RIVER THE RICH VALLEY AND THE NOBLE HILLS WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO BEHOLD AT HER NATIVE HOME NEAR HENLEY UPON THAMES THE HOUSE ITSELF STOOD IN A SHALLOW VALLEY SURROUNDED BY SLOPING MEADOWS WELL SPRINKLED WITH ELM TREES AT THE END OF A SMALL VILLAGE OF COTTAGES
2391-145015-0008.flac,EACH WELL PROVIDED WITH A GARDEN SCATTERED ABOUT PRETTILY ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY COMMODIOUS TO HOLD PUPILS IN ADDITION TO A GROWING FAMILY AND WAS IN THOSE TIMES CONSIDERED TO BE ABOVE THE AVERAGE OF PARSONAGES
2391-145015-0009.flac,NO CORNICE MARKED THE JUNCTION OF WALL AND CEILING WHILE THE BEAMS WHICH SUPPORTED THE UPPER FLOORS PROJECTED INTO THE ROOMS BELOW IN ALL THEIR NAKED SIMPLICITY COVERED ONLY BY A COAT OF PAINT OR WHITEWASH
2391-145015-0010.flac,AND ABOUT FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO IT WAS PULLED DOWN FOR THE PURPOSE OF ERECTING A NEW HOUSE IN A FAR BETTER SITUATION ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE VALLEY
2391-145015-0011.flac,ON THE SOUTH SIDE THE GROUND ROSE GENTLY AND WAS OCCUPIED BY ONE OF THOSE OLD FASHIONED GARDENS IN WHICH VEGETABLES AND FLOWERS ARE COMBINED FLANKED AND PROTECTED ON THE EAST BY ONE OF THE THATCHED MUD WALLS COMMON IN THAT COUNTRY AND OVERSHADOWED BY FINE ELMS
2391-145015-0012.flac,ALONG THE UPPER OR SOUTHERN SIDE OF THIS GARDEN RAN A TERRACE OF THE FINEST TURF
2391-145015-0013.flac,BUT THE CHIEF BEAUTY OF STEVENTON CONSISTED IN ITS HEDGEROWS A HEDGEROW IN THAT COUNTRY DOES NOT MEAN A THIN FORMAL LINE OF QUICKSET BUT AN IRREGULAR BORDER OF COPSE WOOD AND TIMBER OFTEN WIDE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN WITHIN IT A WINDING FOOTPATH OR A ROUGH CART TRACK
2391-145015-0014.flac,AND NOW AND THEN THE UNWELCOME ADDER TWO SUCH HEDGEROWS RADIATED AS IT WERE FROM THE PARSONAGE GARDEN ONE A CONTINUATION OF THE TURF TERRACE PROCEEDED WESTWARD FORMING THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE HOME MEADOWS
2391-145015-0015.flac,AND WAS FORMED INTO A RUSTIC SHRUBBERY WITH OCCASIONAL SEATS ENTITLED THE WOOD WALK THE OTHER RAN STRAIGHT UP THE HILL UNDER THE NAME OF THE CHURCH WALK BECAUSE IT LED TO THE PARISH CHURCH
2391-145015-0016.flac,WHO HAVE FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY RENTED IT TOGETHER WITH THE CHIEF FARM IN THE PARISH THE CHURCH ITSELF I SPEAK OF IT AS IT THEN WAS BEFORE THE IMPROVEMENTS MADE BY THE PRESENT RECTOR
2391-145015-0017.flac,MIGHT HAVE APPEARED MEAN AND UNINTERESTING TO AN ORDINARY OBSERVER BUT THE ADEPT IN CHURCH ARCHITECTURE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT IT MUST HAVE STOOD THERE SOME SEVEN CENTURIES AND WOULD HAVE FOUND BEAUTY IN THE VERY NARROW EARLY ENGLISH WINDOWS
2391-145015-0018.flac,WHILE ITS SOLITARY POSITION FAR FROM THE HUM OF THE VILLAGE AND WITHIN SIGHT OF NO HABITATION EXCEPT A GLIMPSE OF THE GRAY MANOR HOUSE THROUGH ITS CIRCLING SCREEN OF SYCAMORES HAS IN IT SOMETHING SOLEMN AND APPROPRIATE TO THE LAST RESTING PLACE OF THE SILENT DEAD
2391-145015-0019.flac,SWEET VIOLETS BOTH PURPLE AND WHITE GROW IN ABUNDANCE BENEATH ITS SOUTH WALL ONE MAY IMAGINE FOR HOW MANY CENTURIES THE ANCESTORS OF THOSE LITTLE FLOWERS HAVE OCCUPIED THAT UNDISTURBED SUNNY NOOK
2391-145015-0020.flac,THICK COMING FANCIES ROSE IN HER MIND AND GRADUALLY ASSUMED THE FORMS IN WHICH THEY CAME FORTH TO THE WORLD
2391-145015-0021.flac,THE FAMILY WAS UNBROKEN BY DEATH AND SELDOM VISITED BY SORROW THEIR SITUATION HAD SOME PECULIAR ADVANTAGES BEYOND THOSE OF ORDINARY RECTORIES STEVENTON WAS A FAMILY LIVING MISTER KNIGHT THE PATRON WAS ALSO PROPRIETOR OF NEARLY THE WHOLE PARISH
2391-145015-0022.flac,THEY SHARED WITH THE PRINCIPAL TENANT THE COMMAND OF AN EXCELLENT MANOR AND ENJOYED IN THIS REFLECTED WAY SOME OF THE CONSIDERATION USUALLY AWARDED TO LANDED PROPRIETORS
2391-145015-0023.flac,THEY HAD ENOUGH TO AFFORD A GOOD EDUCATION TO THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS TO MIX IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND TO EXERCISE A LIBERAL HOSPITALITY TO THEIR OWN RELATIONS AND FRIENDS A CARRIAGE AND A PAIR OF HORSES WERE KEPT
2391-145015-0024.flac,THIS MIGHT IMPLY A HIGHER STYLE OF LIVING IN OUR DAYS THAN IT DID IN THEIRS THERE WERE THEN NO ASSESSED TAXES THE CARRIAGE ONCE BOUGHT ENTAILED LITTLE FURTHER EXPENSE AND THE HORSES PROBABLY LIKE MISTER BENNET'S WERE OFTEN EMPLOYED ON FARM WORK
2391-145015-0025.flac,MOREOVER IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT A PAIR OF HORSES IN THOSE DAYS WERE ALMOST NECESSARY IF LADIES WERE TO MOVE ABOUT AT ALL
2391-145015-0026.flac,WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE FEW SPECIMENS STILL REMAINING OF COACH BUILDING IN THE LAST CENTURY IT STRIKES ONE THAT THE CHIEF OBJECT OF THE BUILDERS MUST HAVE BEEN TO COMBINE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE WEIGHT WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF ACCOMMODATION
2391-145015-0027.flac,THE FAMILY LIVED IN CLOSE INTIMACY WITH TWO COUSINS EDWARD AND JANE COOPER THE CHILDREN OF MISSUS AUSTEN'S ELDEST SISTER AND DOCTOR COOPER THE VICAR OF SONNING NEAR READING THE COOPERS LIVED FOR SOME YEARS AT BATH
2391-145015-0028.flac,I BELIEVE THAT CASSANDRA AND JANE SOMETIMES VISITED THEM THERE AND THAT JANE THUS ACQUIRED THE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOPOGRAPHY AND CUSTOMS OF BATH WHICH ENABLED HER TO WRITE NORTHANGER ABBEY LONG BEFORE SHE RESIDED THERE HERSELF
2391-145015-0029.flac,AFTER THE DEATH OF THEIR OWN PARENTS THE TWO YOUNG COOPERS PAID LONG VISITS AT STEVENTON EDWARD COOPER DID NOT LIVE UNDISTINGUISHED
2391-145015-0030.flac,AND IN LATER LIFE HE WAS KNOWN BY A WORK ON PROPHECY CALLED THE CRISIS AND OTHER RELIGIOUS PUBLICATIONS ESPECIALLY FOR SEVERAL VOLUMES OF SERMONS MUCH PREACHED IN MANY PULPITS IN MY YOUTH
2391-145015-0031.flac,JANE COOPER WAS MARRIED FROM HER UNCLE'S HOUSE AT STEVENTON TO CAPTAIN AFTERWARDS SIR THOMAS WILLIAMS UNDER WHOM CHARLES AUSTEN SERVED IN SEVERAL SHIPS SHE WAS A DEAR FRIEND OF HER NAMESAKE
2391-145015-0032.flac,BUT WAS FATED TO BECOME A CAUSE OF GREAT SORROW TO HER FOR A FEW YEARS AFTER THE MARRIAGE SHE WAS SUDDENLY KILLED BY AN ACCIDENT TO HER CARRIAGE THERE WAS ANOTHER COUSIN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AT STEVENTON
2391-145015-0033.flac,WHO MUST HAVE INTRODUCED GREATER VARIETY INTO THE FAMILY CIRCLE THIS WAS THE DAUGHTER OF MISTER AUSTEN'S ONLY SISTER MISSUS HANCOCK
2391-145015-0034.flac,OF WHOM I KNOW LITTLE MORE THAN THAT HE PERISHED BY THE GUILLOTINE DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION PERHAPS HIS CHIEF OFFENCE WAS HIS RANK BUT IT WAS SAID THAT THE CHARGE OF INCIVISM UNDER WHICH HE SUFFERED RESTED ON THE FACT OF HIS HAVING LAID DOWN SOME ARABLE LAND INTO PASTURE
2391-145015-0035.flac,HIS WIFE ESCAPED THROUGH DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES TO ENGLAND WAS RECEIVED FOR SOME TIME INTO HER UNCLE'S FAMILY AND FINALLY MARRIED HER COUSIN HENRY AUSTEN
2391-145015-0036.flac,SHE AND HER SECOND HUSBAND WENT TO FRANCE IN THE HOPE OF RECOVERING SOME OF THE COUNT'S PROPERTY AND THERE NARROWLY ESCAPED BEING INCLUDED AMONGST THE DETENUS ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN BY BUONAPARTE'S GOVERNMENT TO DETAIN ALL ENGLISH TRAVELLERS
2391-145015-0037.flac,BUT AT THE POST HOUSES MISSUS HENRY AUSTEN GAVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS HERSELF AND HER FRENCH WAS SO PERFECT THAT SHE PASSED EVERYWHERE FOR A NATIVE
2391-145015-0038.flac,SHE WAS A CLEVER WOMAN AND HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED AFTER THE FRENCH RATHER THAN THE ENGLISH MODE AND IN THOSE DAYS WHEN INTERCOURSE WITH THE CONTINENT WAS LONG INTERRUPTED BY WAR SUCH AN ELEMENT IN THE SOCIETY OF A COUNTRY PARSONAGE MUST HAVE BEEN A RARE ACQUISITION
2391-145015-0039.flac,THE SISTERS MAY HAVE BEEN MORE INDEBTED TO THIS COUSIN THAN TO MISSUS LA TOURNELLE'S TEACHING FOR THE CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF FRENCH WHICH THEY POSSESSED SHE ALSO TOOK THE PRINCIPAL PARTS IN THE PRIVATE THEATRICALS IN WHICH THE FAMILY SEVERAL TIMES INDULGED
2391-145015-0040.flac,HAVING THEIR SUMMER THEATRE IN THE BARN AND THEIR WINTER ONE WITHIN THE NARROW LIMITS OF THE DINING ROOM WHERE THE NUMBER OF THE AUDIENCE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED ON THESE OCCASIONS THE PROLOGUES AND EPILOGUES WERE WRITTEN BY JANE'S ELDEST BROTHER
2391-145015-0041.flac,AND SOME OF THEM ARE VERY VIGOROUS AND AMUSING JANE WAS ONLY TWELVE YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF THE EARLIEST OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND NOT MORE THAN FIFTEEN WHEN THE LAST TOOK PLACE SHE WAS HOWEVER AN EARLY OBSERVER
2391-145015-0042.flac,AND IT MAY BE REASONABLY SUPPOSED THAT SOME OF THE INCIDENTS AND FEELINGS WHICH ARE SO VIVIDLY PAINTED IN THE MANSFIELD PARK THEATRICALS ARE DUE TO HER RECOLLECTIONS OF THESE ENTERTAINMENTS SOME TIME BEFORE THEY LEFT STEVENTON ONE GREAT AFFLICTION CAME UPON THE FAMILY
2391-145015-0043.flac,HE ACCOMPANIED THIS FRIEND TO THE WEST INDIES AS CHAPLAIN TO HIS REGIMENT AND THERE DIED OF YELLOW FEVER TO THE GREAT CONCERN OF HIS FRIEND AND PATRON WHO AFTERWARDS DECLARED THAT IF HE HAD KNOWN OF THE ENGAGEMENT HE WOULD NOT HAVE PERMITTED HIM TO GO OUT TO SUCH A CLIMATE
2391-145015-0044.flac,THIS LITTLE DOMESTIC TRAGEDY CAUSED GREAT AND LASTING GRIEF TO THE PRINCIPAL SUFFERER AND COULD NOT BUT CAST A GLOOM OVER THE WHOLE PARTY THE SYMPATHY OF JANE WAS PROBABLY FROM HER AGE AND HER PECULIAR ATTACHMENT TO HER SISTER
2391-145015-0045.flac,HER REVIEWER IN THE QUARTERLY OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE OBSERVES CONCERNING THE ATTACHMENT OF FANNY PRICE TO EDMUND BERTRAM THE SILENCE IN WHICH THIS PASSION IS CHERISHED THE SLENDER HOPES AND ENJOYMENTS BY WHICH IT IS FED
2391-145015-0046.flac,THE RESTLESSNESS AND JEALOUSY WITH WHICH IT FILLS A MIND NATURALLY ACTIVE CONTENTED AND UNSUSPICIOUS THE MANNER IN WHICH IT TINGES EVERY EVENT AND EVERY REFLECTION ARE PAINTED WITH A VIVIDNESS AND A DETAIL OF WHICH WE CAN SCARCELY CONCEIVE ANY ONE BUT A FEMALE
2391-145015-0047.flac,AND WE SHOULD ALMOST ADD A FEMALE WRITING FROM RECOLLECTION CAPABLE THIS CONJECTURE HOWEVER PROBABLE WAS WIDE OF THE MARK THE PICTURE WAS DRAWN FROM THE INTUITIVE PERCEPTIONS OF GENIUS NOT FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
2391-145015-0048.flac,IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE OF HER LIFE WAS THERE ANY SIMILARITY BETWEEN HERSELF AND HER HEROINE IN MANSFIELD PARK
2391-145015-0049.flac,IN HER YOUTH SHE HAD DECLINED THE ADDRESSES OF A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF GOOD CHARACTER AND CONNECTIONS AND POSITION IN LIFE OF EVERYTHING IN FACT EXCEPT THE SUBTLE POWER OF TOUCHING HER HEART
2391-145015-0050.flac,THERE IS HOWEVER ONE PASSAGE OF ROMANCE IN HER HISTORY WITH WHICH I AM IMPERFECTLY ACQUAINTED AND TO WHICH I AM UNABLE TO ASSIGN NAME OR DATE OR PLACE THOUGH I HAVE IT ON SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY
2391-145015-0051.flac,MANY YEARS AFTER HER DEATH SOME CIRCUMSTANCES INDUCED HER SISTER CASSANDRA TO BREAK THROUGH HER HABITUAL RETICENCE AND TO SPEAK OF IT
2391-145015-0052.flac,WHOSE CHARM OF PERSON MIND AND MANNERS WAS SUCH THAT CASSANDRA THOUGHT HIM WORTHY TO POSSESS AND LIKELY TO WIN HER SISTER'S LOVE WHEN THEY PARTED
2391-145015-0053.flac,AND CASSANDRA FELT NO DOUBT AS TO HIS MOTIVES BUT THEY NEVER AGAIN MET WITHIN A SHORT TIME THEY HEARD OF HIS SUDDEN DEATH I BELIEVE THAT IF JANE EVER LOVED IT WAS THIS UNNAMED GENTLEMAN BUT THE ACQUAINTANCE HAD BEEN SHORT
2391-145015-0054.flac,ANY DESCRIPTION THAT I MIGHT ATTEMPT OF THE FAMILY LIFE AT STEVENTON WHICH CLOSED SOON AFTER I WAS BORN COULD BE LITTLE BETTER THAN A FANCY PIECE
2391-145015-0055.flac,WOULD SEEM STRANGE TO US AND SHOULD MISS MANY MORE TO WHICH WE ARE ACCUSTOMED EVERY HUNDRED YEARS AND ESPECIALLY A CENTURY LIKE THE LAST MARKED BY AN EXTRAORDINARY ADVANCE IN WEALTH LUXURY AND REFINEMENT OF TASTE AS WELL AS IN THE MECHANICAL ARTS WHICH EMBELLISH OUR HOUSES
2391-145015-0056.flac,MUST PRODUCE A GREAT CHANGE IN THEIR ASPECT THESE CHANGES ARE ALWAYS AT WORK THEY ARE GOING ON NOW BUT SO SILENTLY THAT WE TAKE NO NOTE OF THEM MEN SOON FORGET THE SMALL OBJECTS WHICH THEY LEAVE BEHIND THEM AS THEY DRIFT DOWN THE STREAM OF LIFE
2391-145015-0057.flac,AS POPE SAYS NOR DOES LIFE'S STREAM FOR OBSERVATION STAY IT HURRIES ALL TOO FAST TO MARK THEIR WAY IMPORTANT INVENTIONS SUCH AS THE APPLICATIONS OF STEAM GAS AND ELECTRICITY MAY FIND THEIR PLACES IN HISTORY
2391-145015-0058.flac,WHO CAN NOW RECORD THE DEGREES BY WHICH THE CUSTOM PREVALENT IN MY YOUTH OF ASKING EACH OTHER TO TAKE WINE TOGETHER AT DINNER BECAME OBSOLETE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO FIX TWENTY YEARS HENCE THE DATE WHEN OUR DINNERS BEGAN TO BE CARVED AND HANDED ROUND BY SERVANTS
2391-145015-0059.flac,INSTEAD OF SMOKING BEFORE OUR EYES AND NOSES ON THE TABLE TO RECORD SUCH LITTLE MATTERS WOULD INDEED BE TO CHRONICLE SMALL BEER
2391-145015-0060.flac,BUT WHICH THE HISTORIAN HAS THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN RECOVERING AT THAT TIME THE DINNER TABLE PRESENTED A FAR LESS SPLENDID APPEARANCE THAN IT DOES NOW IT WAS APPROPRIATED TO SOLID FOOD RATHER THAN TO FLOWERS FRUITS AND DECORATIONS
2391-145015-0061.flac,NOR WAS THERE MUCH GLITTER OF PLATE UPON IT FOR THE EARLY DINNER HOUR RENDERED CANDLESTICKS UNNECESSARY
2391-145015-0062.flac,THOUGH NOT LESS PLENTIFUL AND SAVOURY AND THE BILL OF FARE IN ONE HOUSE WOULD NOT BE SO LIKE THAT IN ANOTHER AS IT IS NOW FOR FAMILY RECEIPTS WERE HELD IN HIGH ESTIMATION
2391-145015-0063.flac,AND MIGHT INFLUENCE THE FAMILY DINNER FOR MANY GENERATIONS
2391-145015-0064.flac,ONE HOUSE WOULD PRIDE ITSELF ON ITS HAM ANOTHER ON ITS GAME PIE AND A THIRD ON ITS SUPERIOR FURMITY OR TANSEY PUDDING BEER AND HOME MADE WINES ESPECIALLY MEAD WERE MORE LARGELY CONSUMED VEGETABLES WERE LESS PLENTIFUL AND LESS VARIOUS
2391-145015-0065.flac,POTATOES WERE USED BUT NOT SO ABUNDANTLY AS NOW AND THERE WAS AN IDEA THAT THEY WERE TO BE EATEN ONLY WITH ROAST MEAT THEY WERE NOVELTIES TO A TENANT'S WIFE WHO WAS ENTERTAINED AT STEVENTON PARSONAGE CERTAINLY LESS THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
2391-145015-0066.flac,AND WHEN MISSUS AUSTEN ADVISED HER TO PLANT THEM IN HER OWN GARDEN SHE REPLIED NO NO THEY ARE VERY WELL FOR YOU GENTRY BUT THEY MUST BE TERRIBLY COSTLY TO REAR BUT A STILL GREATER DIFFERENCE WOULD BE FOUND IN THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOMS
2391-145015-0067.flac,WHICH WOULD APPEAR TO US LAMENTABLY SCANTY THERE WAS A GENERAL DEFICIENCY OF CARPETING IN SITTING ROOMS BED ROOMS AND PASSAGES A PIANOFORTE OR RATHER A SPINNET OR HARPSICHORD WAS BY NO MEANS A NECESSARY APPENDAGE
2391-145015-0068.flac,IT WAS TO BE FOUND ONLY WHERE THERE WAS A DECIDED TASTE FOR MUSIC NOT SO COMMON THEN AS NOW OR IN SUCH GREAT HOUSES AS WOULD PROBABLY CONTAIN A BILLIARD TABLE THERE WOULD OFTEN BE BUT ONE SOFA IN THE HOUSE AND THAT A STIFF ANGULAR
2391-145015-0069.flac,UNCOMFORTABLE ARTICLE THERE WERE NO DEEP EASY CHAIRS NOR OTHER APPLIANCES FOR LOUNGING FOR TO LIE DOWN OR EVEN TO LEAN BACK WAS A LUXURY PERMITTED ONLY TO OLD PERSONS OR INVALIDS
2391-145015-0070.flac,AND A MODEL GENTLEMAN OF HIS DAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE MADE THE TOUR OF EUROPE WITHOUT EVER TOUCHING THE BACK OF HIS TRAVELLING CARRIAGE BUT PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE MOST STRUCK WITH THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF THOSE ELEGANT LITTLE ARTICLES WHICH NOW EMBELLISH AND ENCUMBER OUR DRAWING ROOM TABLES
2391-145015-0071.flac,WE SHOULD MISS THE SLIDING BOOKCASES AND PICTURE STANDS
2391-145015-0072.flac,THE PERIODICALS AND ILLUSTRATED NEWSPAPERS ABOVE ALL
2391-145015-0073.flac,A SMALL WRITING DESK WITH A SMALLER WORK BOX OR NETTING CASE WAS ALL THAT EACH YOUNG LADY CONTRIBUTED TO OCCUPY THE TABLE FOR THE LARGE FAMILY WORK BASKET THOUGH OFTEN PRODUCED IN THE PARLOUR LIVED IN THE CLOSET
2391-145015-0074.flac,THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE DANCING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN THOSE DAYS THAN THERE IS NOW
2391-145015-0075.flac,AS IF IT WERE A NATURAL PRODUCTION WITH LESS FASTIDIOUSNESS AS TO THE QUALITY OF MUSIC LIGHTS AND FLOOR MANY COUNTRY TOWNS HAD A MONTHLY BALL THROUGHOUT THE WINTER IN SOME OF WHICH THE SAME APARTMENT SERVED FOR DANCING AND TEA ROOM
2391-145015-0076.flac,TO THE MUSIC OF A HARPSICHORD IN THE HOUSE OR A FIDDLE FROM THE VILLAGE THIS WAS ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE
2391-145015-0077.flac,FOR SHE ATTRIBUTES THIS TASTE TO HER FAVOURITE HEROINES
2391-145015-0078.flac,AND MADE OF IMPORTANCE MANY THINGS CONNECTED WITH THE BALL ROOMS OF THOSE DAYS HAVE NOW PASSED INTO OBLIVION THE BARBAROUS LAW WHICH CONFINED THE LADY TO ONE PARTNER THROUGHOUT THE EVENING MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN ABOLISHED BEFORE JANE WENT TO BALLS
2391-145015-0079.flac,IT MUST BE OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT THIS CUSTOM WAS IN ONE RESPECT ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE GENTLEMAN INASMUCH AS IT RENDERED HIS DUTIES MORE PRACTICABLE HE WAS BOUND TO CALL UPON HIS PARTNER THE NEXT MORNING
2391-145015-0080.flac,TO GALLOP ALL THE COUNTRY OVER THE LAST NIGHT'S PARTNER TO BEHOLD AND HUMBLY HOPE SHE CAUGHT NO COLD BUT THE STATELY MINUET STILL REIGNED SUPREME AND EVERY REGULAR BALL COMMENCED WITH IT IT WAS A SLOW AND SOLEMN MOVEMENT
2391-145015-0081.flac,EXPRESSIVE OF GRACE AND DIGNITY RATHER THAN OF MERRIMENT IT ABOUNDED IN FORMAL BOWS AND COURTESIES WITH MEASURED PACES FORWARDS BACKWARDS AND SIDEWAYS AND MANY COMPLICATED GYRATIONS
2391-145015-0082.flac,IT WAS EXECUTED BY ONE LADY AND GENTLEMAN AMIDST THE ADMIRATION OR THE CRITICISM OF SURROUNDING SPECTATORS IN ITS EARLIER AND MOST PALMY DAYS AS WHEN SIR CHARLES AND LADY GRANDISON DELIGHTED THE COMPANY BY DANCING IT AT THEIR OWN WEDDING
2391-145015-0083.flac,THE GENTLEMAN WORE A DRESS SWORD AND THE LADY WAS ARMED WITH A FAN OF NEARLY EQUAL DIMENSIONS ADDISON OBSERVES THAT WOMEN ARE ARMED WITH FANS AS MEN WITH SWORDS AND SOMETIMES DO MORE EXECUTION WITH THEM
2391-145015-0084.flac,THE GRACEFUL CARRIAGE OF EACH WEAPON WAS CONSIDERED A TEST OF HIGH BREEDING THE CLOWNISH MAN WAS IN DANGER OF BEING TRIPPED UP BY HIS SWORD GETTING BETWEEN HIS LEGS
2391-145015-0085.flac,AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THOSE LADIES WHO INTENDED TO DANCE MINUETS USED TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES FROM OTHERS BY WEARING A PARTICULAR KIND OF LAPPET ON THEIR HEAD DRESS I HAVE HEARD ALSO OF ANOTHER CURIOUS PROOF OF THE RESPECT IN WHICH THIS DANCE WAS HELD
2391-145015-0086.flac,GLOVES IMMACULATELY CLEAN WERE CONSIDERED REQUISITE FOR ITS DUE PERFORMANCE WHILE GLOVES A LITTLE SOILED WERE THOUGHT GOOD ENOUGH FOR A COUNTRY DANCE AND ACCORDINGLY SOME PRUDENT LADIES PROVIDED THEMSELVES WITH TWO PAIRS FOR THEIR SEVERAL PURPOSES
2391-145015-0087.flac,THE MINUET EXPIRED WITH THE LAST CENTURY BUT LONG AFTER IT HAD CEASED TO BE DANCED PUBLICLY IT WAS TAUGHT TO BOYS AND GIRLS IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM A GRACEFUL CARRIAGE HORNPIPES COTILLONS AND REELS WERE OCCASIONALLY DANCED
2391-145015-0088.flac,BUT THE CHIEF OCCUPATION OF THE EVENING WAS THE INTERMINABLE COUNTRY DANCE IN WHICH ALL COULD JOIN THIS DANCE PRESENTED A GREAT SHOW OF ENJOYMENT BUT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS PECULIAR TROUBLES
2391-145015-0089.flac,THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WERE RANGED APART FROM EACH OTHER IN OPPOSITE ROWS SO THAT THE FACILITIES FOR FLIRTATION OR INTERESTING INTERCOURSE WERE NOT SO GREAT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DESIRED BY BOTH PARTIES MUCH HEART BURNING AND DISCONTENT SOMETIMES AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD STAND ABOVE WHOM
2391-145015-0090.flac,AND ESPECIALLY AS TO WHO WAS ENTITLED TO THE HIGH PRIVILEGE OF CALLING AND LEADING OFF THE FIRST DANCE AND NO LITTLE INDIGNATION WAS FELT AT THE LOWER END OF THE ROOM WHEN ANY OF THE LEADING COUPLES RETIRED PREMATURELY FROM THEIR DUTIES AND DID NOT CONDESCEND TO DANCE UP AND DOWN THE WHOLE SET
2391-145015-0091.flac,WE MAY REJOICE THAT THESE CAUSES OF IRRITATION NO LONGER EXIST AND THAT IF SUCH FEELINGS AS JEALOUSY RIVALRY AND DISCONTENT EVER TOUCH CELESTIAL BOSOMS IN THE MODERN BALL ROOM THEY MUST ARISE FROM DIFFERENT AND MORE RECONDITE SOURCES
2391-145015-0092.flac,I AM TEMPTED TO ADD A LITTLE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE OF PERSONAL HABITS IT MAY BE ASSERTED AS A GENERAL TRUTH THAT LESS WAS LEFT TO THE CHARGE AND DISCRETION OF SERVANTS AND MORE WAS DONE OR SUPERINTENDED BY THE MASTERS AND MISTRESSES
2391-145015-0093.flac,WITH REGARD TO THE MISTRESSES IT IS I BELIEVE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT AT THE TIME TO WHICH I REFER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THEY TOOK A PERSONAL PART IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF COOKERY AS WELL AS IN THE CONCOCTION OF HOME MADE WINES
2391-145015-0094.flac,AND DISTILLING OF HERBS FOR DOMESTIC MEDICINES WHICH ARE NEARLY ALLIED TO THE SAME ART LADIES DID NOT DISDAIN TO SPIN THE THREAD OF WHICH THE HOUSEHOLD LINEN WAS WOVEN SOME LADIES LIKED TO WASH WITH THEIR OWN HANDS THEIR CHOICE CHINA AFTER BREAKFAST OR TEA
2391-145015-0095.flac,AS THAT THEY TOOK AN INTEREST IN SUCH OCCUPATIONS AND IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND HOW MANY SOURCES OF INTEREST ENJOYED BY THIS GENERATION WERE THEN CLOSED OR VERY SCANTILY OPENED TO LADIES A VERY SMALL MINORITY OF THEM CARED MUCH FOR LITERATURE OR SCIENCE
2391-145015-0096.flac,BUT I DOUBT WHETHER THE RISING GENERATION ARE EQUALLY AWARE HOW MUCH GENTLEMEN ALSO DID FOR THEMSELVES IN THOSE TIMES
2391-145015-0097.flac,THAN THEY ARE NOW MASTER'S EYE MAKES THE HORSE FAT AND IF YOU WOULD BE WELL SERVED SERVE YOURSELF SOME GENTLEMEN TOOK PLEASURE IN BEING THEIR OWN GARDENERS PERFORMING ALL THE SCIENTIFIC AND SOME OF THE MANUAL WORK THEMSELVES
2391-145015-0098.flac,WELL DRESSED YOUNG MEN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD THEIR COAT FROM A LONDON TAILOR WOULD ALWAYS BRUSH THEIR EVENING SUIT THEMSELVES RATHER THAN ENTRUST IT TO THE CARELESSNESS OF A ROUGH SERVANT AND TO THE RISKS OF DIRT AND GREASE IN THE KITCHEN
2391-145015-0099.flac,FOR IN THOSE DAYS SERVANTS HALLS WERE NOT COMMON IN THE HOUSES OF THE CLERGY AND THE SMALLER COUNTRY GENTRY IT WAS QUITE NATURAL THAT CATHERINE MORLAND SHOULD HAVE CONTRASTED THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THE OFFICES AT NORTHANGER ABBEY WITH THE FEW SHAPELESS PANTRIES IN HER FATHER'S PARSONAGE
2391-145015-0100.flac,A YOUNG MAN WHO EXPECTED TO HAVE HIS THINGS PACKED OR UNPACKED FOR HIM BY A SERVANT WHEN HE TRAVELLED
2391-145015-0101.flac,IT WAS THOUGHT MERITORIOUS ON THE EVENING OF A HUNTING DAY TO TURN OUT AFTER DINNER LANTHORN IN HAND AND VISIT THE STABLE TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE HORSE HAD BEEN WELL CARED FOR THIS WAS OF THE MORE IMPORTANCE BECAUSE PREVIOUS TO THE INTRODUCTION OF CLIPPING ABOUT THE YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY
2391-145015-0102.flac,IT WAS A DIFFICULT AND TEDIOUS WORK TO MAKE A LONG COATED HUNTER DRY AND COMFORTABLE AND WAS OFTEN VERY IMPERFECTLY DONE OF COURSE SUCH THINGS WERE NOT PRACTISED BY THOSE WHO HAD GAMEKEEPERS AND STUD GROOMS AND PLENTY OF WELL TRAINED SERVANTS
2391-145015-0103.flac,BUT THEY WERE PRACTISED BY MANY WHO WERE UNEQUIVOCALLY GENTLEMEN AND WHOSE GRANDSONS OCCUPYING THE SAME POSITION IN LIFE MAY PERHAPS BE ASTONISHED AT BEING TOLD THAT SUCH THINGS WERE
2391-145015-0104.flac,OF COURSE THEY CANNOT BE UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE SUCH DETAILS VARIED IN VARIOUS CIRCLES AND WERE CHANGED VERY GRADUALLY
2391-145015-0105.flac,BUT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THEIR WAY OF LIFE DIFFERED A LITTLE FROM OURS
2391-145015-0106.flac,IT MAY BE THAT USEFUL ARTICLES WHICH WOULD NOT NOW BE PRODUCED IN DRAWING ROOMS WERE HEMMED AND MARKED AND DARNED IN THE OLD FASHIONED PARLOUR BUT ALL THIS CONCERNED ONLY THE OUTER LIFE THERE WAS AS MUCH CULTIVATION AND REFINEMENT OF MIND AS NOW
2391-145015-0107.flac,THE EARLY HOUR AT WHICH HOUNDS THEN MET MAY ACCOUNT FOR THIS
2391-145015-0108.flac,FOR THEY HUNTED AT AN EARLY AGE IN A SCRAMBLING SORT OF WAY UPON ANY PONY OR DONKEY THAT THEY COULD PROCURE OR IN DEFAULT OF SUCH LUXURIES ON FOOT I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT SIR FRANCIS AUSTEN WHEN SEVEN YEARS OLD
2391-145015-0109.flac,BOUGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT IT MUST BE SUPPOSED WITH HIS FATHER'S PERMISSION A PONY FOR A GUINEA AND A HALF AND AFTER RIDING HIM WITH GREAT SUCCESS FOR TWO SEASONS SOLD HIM FOR A GUINEA MORE
2391-145015-0110.flac,THE SAME AUTHORITY INFORMS ME THAT HIS FIRST CLOTH SUIT WAS MADE FROM A SCARLET HABIT WHICH ACCORDING TO THE FASHION OF THE TIMES HAD BEEN HIS MOTHER'S USUAL MORNING DRESS IF ALL THIS IS TRUE
2391-145015-0111.flac,THE FUTURE ADMIRAL OF THE BRITISH FLEET MUST HAVE CUT A CONSPICUOUS FIGURE IN THE HUNTING FIELD THE OTHER PECULIARITY WAS THAT WHEN THE ROADS WERE DIRTY THE SISTERS TOOK LONG WALKS IN PATTENS THIS DEFENCE AGAINST WET AND DIRT IS NOW SELDOM SEEN
2391-145015-0112.flac,THE FEW THAT REMAIN ARE BANISHED FROM GOOD SOCIETY AND EMPLOYED ONLY IN MENIAL WORK BUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO THEY WERE CELEBRATED IN POETRY AND CONSIDERED SO CLEVER A CONTRIVANCE THAT GAY IN HIS TRIVIA
2391-145015-0113.flac,ASCRIBES THE INVENTION TO A GOD STIMULATED BY HIS PASSION FOR A MORTAL DAMSEL AND DERIVES THE NAME PATTEN FROM PATTY THE PATTEN NOW SUPPORTS EACH FRUGAL DAME WHICH FROM THE BLUE EYED PATTY TAKES THE NAME
2391-145015-0114.flac,BUT MORTAL DAMSELS HAVE LONG AGO DISCARDED THE CLUMSY IMPLEMENT FIRST IT DROPPED ITS IRON RING AND BECAME A CLOG AFTERWARDS IT WAS FINED DOWN INTO THE PLIANT GALOSHE LIGHTER TO WEAR AND MORE EFFECTUAL TO PROTECT
2391-145015-0115.flac,A NO LESS MANIFEST INSTANCE OF GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT THAN COWPER INDICATES WHEN HE TRACES THROUGH EIGHTY LINES OF POETRY HIS ACCOMPLISHED SOFA BACK TO THE ORIGINAL THREE LEGGED STOOL
2391-145015-0116.flac,I ADD THE FOLLOWING EPIGRAM WRITTEN BY JANE AUSTEN'S UNCLE MISTER LEIGH PERROT ON READING IN A NEWSPAPER THE MARRIAGE OF CAPTAIN FOOTE TO MISS PATTEN THROUGH THE ROUGH PATHS OF LIFE WITH A PATTEN YOUR GUARD MAY YOU SAFELY AND PLEASANTLY JOG
2391-145015-0117.flac,MAY THE KNOT NEVER SLIP NOR THE RING PRESS TOO HARD NOR THE FOOT FIND THE PATTEN A CLOG AT THE TIME WHEN JANE AUSTEN LIVED AT STEVENTON A WORK WAS CARRIED ON IN THE NEIGHBOURING COTTAGES WHICH OUGHT TO BE RECORDED BECAUSE IT HAS LONG CEASED TO EXIST
2391-145015-0118.flac,THIS WAS A BETTER OCCUPATION FOR THEM THAN STRAW PLAITING
2391-145015-0119.flac,AND DID NOT ADMIT OF GADDING AND GOSSIPING ABOUT THE VILLAGE THE IMPLEMENT USED WAS A LONG NARROW MACHINE OF WOOD RAISED ON LEGS FURNISHED AT ONE END WITH A LARGE WHEEL AND AT THE OTHER WITH A SPINDLE ON WHICH THE FLAX OR WOOL WAS LOOSELY WRAPPED
2391-145015-0120.flac,BALLAD POETRY AND FAIRY TALES ARE FULL OF ALLUSIONS TO IT
2391-145015-0121.flac,IT WAS THE LABOUR ASSIGNED TO THE EJECTED NUNS BY THE ROUGH EARL WHO SAID GO SPIN YE JADES GO SPIN IT WAS THE EMPLOYMENT AT WHICH ROMAN MATRONS AND GRECIAN PRINCESSES PRESIDED AMONGST THEIR HANDMAIDS
2391-145015-0122.flac,HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY CELEBRATED IT IN THE THREE FATES SPINNING AND MEASURING OUT THE THREAD OF HUMAN LIFE
32-21631-0000.flac,AFTER MISTER CROW FLEW BACK TO PLEASANT VALLEY TO GATHER NEWS FOR HIM BROWNIE BEAVER CAREFULLY COUNTED EACH DAY THAT PASSED SINCE MISTER CROW HAD AGREED TO BE HIS NEWSPAPER AND COME EACH SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO TELL HIM EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED DURING THE WEEK
32-21631-0001.flac,BROWNIE WAS IN A GREAT HURRY FOR SATURDAY TO ARRIVE IN ORDER TO MAKE NO MISTAKE HE PUT ASIDE A STICK IN WHICH HE GNAWED A NOTCH EACH DAY AND IN THAT WAY HE KNEW EXACTLY WHEN SATURDAY CAME
32-21631-0002.flac,THAT WAS PROBABLY THE LONGEST DAY IN BROWNIE BEAVER'S LIFE AT LEAST IT SEEMED SO TO HIM WHENEVER HE SAW A BIRD SOARING ABOVE THE TREE TOPS HE COULDN'T HELP HOPING IT WAS MISTER CROW
32-21631-0003.flac,BROWNIE BEAVER DROPPED WHATEVER HE HAPPENED TO BE DOING EXPECTING THAT MISTER CROW WOULD FLAP INTO SIGHT AT ANY MOMENT BROWNIE HAD MANY DISAPPOINTMENTS BUT MISTER CROW REALLY CAME AT LAST
32-21631-0004.flac,HE LIGHTED RIGHT ON TOP OF BROWNIE BEAVER'S HOUSE AND CALLED PAPER DOWN THE CHIMNEY JUST LIKE THAT BROWNIE HAPPENED TO BE INSIDE HIS HOUSE AND IN A WONDERFULLY SHORT TIME HIS HEAD APPEARED

32-21631-0016.flac,HE WAS AFRAID THAT IF HE SAID ANOTHER WORD MISTER CROW WOULD GROW ANGRY AND FLY AWAY WITHOUT TELLING HIM ANY MORE NEWS
32-21631-0017.flac,JIMMY RABBIT ALMOST CUT OFF FRISKY SQUIRREL'S TAIL MISTER CROW PAUSED AND LOOKED AT BROWNIE BEAVER OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE HE KNEW THAT BROWNIE WOULD WANT TO KNOW WHAT PREVENTED THE ACCIDENT BUT HE WAS IN NO HURRY TO TELL HIM
32-21631-0018.flac,FOR A FEW MOMENTS BROWNIE WAITED TO HEAR THE REST BUT A FEW MOMENTS WAS MORE THAN HE COULD ENDURE WHY DIDN'T JIMMY CUT OFF HIS TAIL BROWNIE ASKED EAGERLY THERE SAID MISTER CROW YOU'VE DONE JUST AS I TOLD YOU NOT TO
32-21631-0019.flac,SO I SHALL NOT TELL YOU THE REST UNTIL NEXT SATURDAY YOU SEE YOU HAVE A FEW THINGS TO LEARN ABOUT TAKING A NEWSPAPER
32-21625-0000.flac,WAS NOT THE ONLY VILLAGE TO BE SEEN FROM BLUE MOUNTAIN THERE WAS ANOTHER WHICH FARMER GREEN SELDOM VISITED BECAUSE IT LAY BEYOND THE MOUNTAIN AND WAS A LONG DISTANCE FROM HIS HOUSE THOUGH HE OWNED THE LAND WHERE IT STOOD
32-21625-0001.flac,THOSE THAT LIVED THERE THOUGHT THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO STAY THERE AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED WITHOUT BEING DISTURBED IT WAS IN THIS VILLAGE THAT BROWNIE BEAVER AND HIS NEIGHBORS LIVED IT WAS A DIFFERENT SORT OF TOWN TOO
32-21625-0002.flac,FROM THE ONE WHERE FARMER GREEN WENT EACH WEEK OVER BEYOND BLUE MOUNTAIN ALL THE HOUSES WERE BUILT IN A POND AND ALL THEIR DOORS WERE UNDER WATER BUT NOBODY MINDED THAT BECAUSE LIKE BROWNIE BEAVER
32-21625-0003.flac,EVERYBODY THAT DWELT THERE WAS A FINE SWIMMER YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE BROWNIE'S TIME HIS FOREFATHERS HAD COME THERE AND FINDING THAT THERE WERE MANY TREES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE SORT OF BARK THEY LIKED TO EAT
32-21625-0004.flac,SUCH AS POPLARS WILLOWS AND BOX ELDERS THEY HAD DECIDED THAT IT WAS A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE THERE WAS A SMALL STREAM TOO WHICH WAS REALLY THE BEGINNING OF SWIFT RIVER
32-21625-0005.flac,AND BY DAMMING IT THOSE OLD SETTLERS MADE A POND IN WHICH THEY COULD BUILD THEIR HOUSES THEY HAD IDEAS OF THEIR OWN AS TO WHAT A HOUSE SHOULD BE LIKE
32-21625-0006.flac,THOUGH YOU PERHAPS MIGHT NOT CARE FOR THEM AT ALL THEY WANTED THEIR HOUSES TO BE SURROUNDED BY WATER BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE SAFER WHEN BUILT IN THAT MANNER AND THEY ALWAYS INSISTED THAT A DOOR LEADING INTO A HOUSE
32-21625-0007.flac,SHOULD BE FAR BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER FOR THEY BELIEVED THAT THAT MADE A HOUSE SAFER TOO TO YOU SUCH AN IDEA MAY SEEM VERY STRANGE BUT IF YOU WERE CHASED BY AN ENEMY YOU MIGHT BE GLAD TO BE ABLE TO SWIM UNDER WATER
32-21625-0008.flac,DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF A POND AND SLIP INSIDE A DOOR WHICH LED TO A WINDING HALL
32-21625-0009.flac,OF COURSE YOUR ENEMY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SWIM AS WELL AS YOU BUT MAYBE HE WOULD THINK TWICE OR EVEN THREE TIMES BEFORE HE WENT PROWLING THROUGH YOUR CROOKED HALL FOR IF YOU HAD ENORMOUS STRONG SHARP TEETH
32-21625-0010.flac,WITH WHICH YOU COULD GNAW RIGHT THROUGH A TREE HE WOULD NOT CARE TO HAVE YOU SEIZE HIM AS HE POKED HIS HEAD AROUND A CORNER IN A DARK PASSAGE OF A STRANGE HOUSE IT WAS IN A HOUSE OF THAT KIND THAT BROWNIE BEAVER LIVED
32-21625-0011.flac,AND HE BUILT IT HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SAID HE WOULD RATHER HAVE A NEAT NEW HOUSE THAN ONE OF THE BIG OLD DWELLINGS THAT HAD BEEN BUILT MANY YEARS BEFORE WHEN HIS GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER HAD HELPED THROW THE DAM ACROSS THE STREAM THE DAM WAS THERE STILL
32-21625-0012.flac,IT WAS SO OLD THAT TREES WERE GROWING ON IT AND THERE WAS AN ODD THING ABOUT IT IT WAS NEVER FINISHED THOUGH BROWNIE BEAVER WAS A YOUNG CHAP HE WORKED ON THE DAM SOMETIMES LIKE ALL HIS NEIGHBORS
32-21625-0013.flac,YOU SEE THE VILLAGERS KEPT MAKING THE DAM WIDER AND SINCE IT WAS BUILT OF STICKS AND MUD THE WATER SOMETIMES WASHED BITS OF IT AWAY SO IT HAD TO BE KEPT IN REPAIR IF BROWNIE BEAVER AND HIS FRIENDS HAD NEGLECTED THEIR DAM
32-21625-0014.flac,AND WITHOUT ANY WATER TO HIDE THEIR DOORWAYS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE NO LONGER THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NO PLACE EITHER TO STORE THEIR WINTER'S FOOD FOR THEY WERE IN THE HABIT OF CUTTING DOWN TREES AND SAVING THE BARK AND BRANCHES TOO
32-21625-0015.flac,IN ORDER TO HAVE PLENTY TO EAT WHEN COLD WEATHER CAME AND THE ICE CLOSED THEIR POND SOME OF THEIR FOOD THEY CARRIED INTO THEIR HOUSES THROUGH A STRAIGHT HALL WHICH WAS MADE FOR THAT VERY PURPOSE
32-21625-0016.flac,AND SOME OF THE BRANCHES THEY FASTENED UNDER WATER NEAR THE DAM IT WAS JUST LIKE PUTTING GREEN THINGS INTO A REFRIGERATOR SO THEY WILL KEEP NOW YOU SEE WHY BROWNIE BEAVER WOULD NO MORE HAVE THOUGHT OF BUILDING HIS HOUSE ON DRY LAND
32-21625-0017.flac,THAN YOU WOULD THINK OF BUILDING ONE IN A POND EVERYBODY LIKES HIS OWN WAY BEST AND IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO BROWNIE BEAVER THAT HIS WAY WAS THE LEAST BIT STRANGE
32-4137-0000.flac,CHAPTER TWO GOING TO THE SOUTH MY COUNTRY SHALL THY HONOURED NAME BE AS A BYE WORD THROUGH THE WORLD ROUSE FOR AS IF TO BLAST THY FAME THIS KEEN REPROACH IS AT THEE HURLED
32-4137-0001.flac,THE BANNER THAT ABOVE THE WAVES IS FLOATING O'ER THREE MILLION SLAVES DICK WALKER THE SLAVE SPECULATOR WHO HAD PURCHASED CURRER AND ALTHESA PUT THEM IN PRISON UNTIL HIS GANG WAS MADE UP
32-4137-0002.flac,AND THEN WITH HIS FORTY SLAVES STARTED FOR THE NEW ORLEANS MARKET AS MANY OF THE SLAVES HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN RICHMOND AND HAD RELATIONS RESIDING THERE THE SLAVE TRADER DETERMINED TO LEAVE THE CITY EARLY IN THE MORNING
32-4137-0003.flac,SO AS NOT TO WITNESS ANY OF THOSE SCENES SO COMMON WHERE SLAVES ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR RELATIVES AND FRIENDS WHEN ABOUT DEPARTING FOR THE SOUTHERN MARKET THIS PLAN WAS SUCCESSFUL FOR NOT EVEN CLOTEL WHO HAD BEEN EVERY DAY AT THE PRISON TO SEE HER MOTHER AND SISTER
32-4137-0004.flac,KNEW OF THEIR DEPARTURE A MARCH OF EIGHT DAYS THROUGH THE INTERIOR OF THE STATE AND THEY ARRIVED ON THE BANKS OF THE OHIO RIVER WHERE THEY WERE ALL PUT ON BOARD A STEAMER AND THEN SPEEDILY SAILED FOR THE PLACE OF THEIR DESTINATION
32-4137-0005.flac,WALKER HAD ALREADY ADVERTISED IN THE NEW ORLEANS PAPERS THAT HE WOULD BE THERE AT A STATED TIME WITH A PRIME LOT OF ABLE BODIED SLAVES READY FOR FIELD SERVICE TOGETHER WITH A FEW EXTRA ONES BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE
32-4137-0006.flac,BUT LIKE MOST WHO MAKE A BUSINESS OF BUYING AND SELLING SLAVES FOR GAIN HE OFTEN BOUGHT SOME WHO WERE FAR ADVANCED IN YEARS AND WOULD ALWAYS TRY TO SELL THEM FOR FIVE OR TEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN THEY ACTUALLY WERE
32-4137-0007.flac,FEW PERSONS CAN ARRIVE AT ANYTHING LIKE THE AGE OF A NEGRO BY MERE OBSERVATION UNLESS THEY ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE RACE THEREFORE THE SLAVE TRADER VERY FREQUENTLY CARRIED OUT THIS DECEPTION WITH PERFECT IMPUNITY AFTER THE STEAMER HAD LEFT THE WHARF
32-4137-0008.flac,AND INSTRUCTED HIM AS TO GETTING THE NEGROES READY FOR MARKET AMONGST THE FORTY NEGROES WERE SEVERAL WHOSE APPEARANCE INDICATED THAT THEY HAD SEEN SOME YEARS AND HAD GONE THROUGH SOME SERVICES
32-4137-0009.flac,THEIR GREY HAIR AND WHISKERS AT ONCE PRONOUNCED THEM TO BE ABOVE THE AGES SET DOWN IN THE TRADER'S ADVERTISEMENT
32-4137-0010.flac,AND IF HE DID NOT TAKE DELIGHT IN DISCHARGING HIS DUTY HE DID IT WITH A DEGREE OF ALACRITY SO THAT HE MIGHT RECEIVE THE APPROBATION OF HIS MASTER POMP AS WALKER USUALLY CALLED HIM WAS OF REAL NEGRO BLOOD AND WOULD OFTEN SAY WHEN ALLUDING TO HIMSELF
32-4137-0011.flac,DIS NIGGER IS NO COUNTEFIT HE IS DE GENEWINE ARTEKIL
32-4137-0012.flac,HAD A SET OF TEETH WHICH FOR WHITENESS AND BEAUTY COULD NOT BE SURPASSED HIS EYES LARGE LIPS THICK AND HAIR SHORT AND WOOLLY
32-4137-0013.flac,THAT HE APPEARED PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT TO THE HEARTRENDING SCENES WHICH DAILY OCCURRED IN HIS PRESENCE IT WAS ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE STEAMER'S VOYAGE THAT POMPEY SELECTED FIVE OF THE OLD SLAVES TOOK THEM IN A ROOM BY THEMSELVES AND COMMENCED PREPARING THEM FOR THE MARKET
32-4137-0014.flac,WELL SAID POMPEY ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE COMPANY I IS DE GENTMAN DAT IS TO GET YOU READY SO DAT YOU WILL BRING MARSER A GOOD PRICE IN DE ORLEANS MARKET HOW OLD IS YOU
32-4137-0015.flac,ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO A MAN WHO FROM APPEARANCE WAS NOT LESS THAN FORTY IF I LIVE TO SEE NEXT CORN PLANTING TIME I WILL EITHER BE FORTY FIVE OR FIFTY FIVE I DON'T KNOW WHICH

32-4137-0017.flac,BUT WHEN YOU GET IN DE MARKET AN ANYBODY AXE YOU HOW OLD YOU IS AN YOU TELL EM FORTY FIVE MARSER WILL TIE YOU UP AN GIB YOU DE WHIP LIKE SMOKE
32-4137-0018.flac,WELL DEN I GUESS I WILL ONLY BE THIRTY WHEN DEY AXE ME REPLIED THE CHATTEL

32-4137-0021.flac,YOU IS NOW TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD AN NO MORE DUS YOU HEAR DAT YES RESPONDED TOBY
32-4137-0022.flac,AND THEN REPORTED TO HIS MASTER THAT THE OLD BOYS WERE ALL RIGHT AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY THE LIGHTS OF ANOTHER STEAMER WERE SEEN IN THE DISTANCE AND APPARENTLY COMING UP VERY FAST THIS WAS A SIGNAL FOR A GENERAL COMMOTION ON THE PATRIOT
32-4137-0023.flac,AND EVERYTHING INDICATED THAT A STEAMBOAT RACE WAS AT HAND NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE EXCITEMENT ATTENDANT UPON A STEAMBOAT RACE ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BY THE TIME THE BOATS HAD REACHED MEMPHIS THEY WERE SIDE BY SIDE
32-4137-0024.flac,AND EACH EXERTING ITSELF TO KEEP THE ASCENDANCY IN POINT OF SPEED THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR THE MOON SHINING BRIGHTLY AND THE BOATS SO NEAR TO EACH OTHER THAT THE PASSENGERS WERE CALLING OUT FROM ONE BOAT TO THE OTHER
32-4137-0025.flac,ON BOARD THE PATRIOT THE FIREMEN WERE USING OIL LARD BUTTER AND EVEN BACON WITH THE WOOD FOR THE PURPOSE OF RAISING THE STEAM TO ITS HIGHEST PITCH THE BLAZE MINGLED WITH THE BLACK SMOKE SHOWED PLAINLY THAT THE OTHER BOAT WAS BURNING MORE THAN WOOD
32-4137-0026.flac,THE TWO BOATS SOON LOCKED SO THAT THE HANDS OF THE BOATS WERE PASSING FROM VESSEL TO VESSEL AND THE WILDEST EXCITEMENT PREVAILED THROUGHOUT AMONGST BOTH PASSENGERS AND CREW
32-4137-0027.flac,AT THIS MOMENT THE ENGINEER OF THE PATRIOT WAS SEEN TO FASTEN DOWN THE SAFETY VALVE SO THAT NO STEAM SHOULD ESCAPE THIS WAS INDEED A DANGEROUS RESORT
32-4137-0028.flac,THE PATRIOT STOPPED TO TAKE IN PASSENGERS AND STILL NO STEAM WAS PERMITTED TO ESCAPE
32-4137-0029.flac,AND AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED ONE OF THE BOILERS IMMEDIATELY EXPLODED ONE DENSE FOG OF STEAM FILLED EVERY PART OF THE VESSEL WHILE SHRIEKS GROANS AND CRIES WERE HEARD ON EVERY HAND THE SALOONS AND CABINS SOON HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A HOSPITAL
32-4137-0030.flac,BY THIS TIME THE BOAT HAD LANDED AND THE COLUMBIA THE OTHER BOAT
32-4137-0031.flac,THE KILLED AND SCALDED NINETEEN IN NUMBER
32-4137-0032.flac,THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS CHANGE HANDS DURING A PASSAGE FROM LOUISVILLE OR SAINT LOUIS TO NEW ORLEANS ON A MISSISSIPPI STEAMER AND MANY MEN AND EVEN LADIES ARE COMPLETELY RUINED GO CALL MY BOY STEWARD
32-4137-0033.flac,SAID MISTER SMITH AS HE TOOK HIS CARDS ONE BY ONE FROM THE TABLE IN A FEW MOMENTS A FINE LOOKING BRIGHT EYED MULATTO BOY APPARENTLY ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE WAS STANDING BY HIS MASTER'S SIDE AT THE TABLE
32-4137-0034.flac,I WILL SEE YOU AND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BETTER SAID SMITH AS HIS SERVANT JERRY APPROACHED THE TABLE
32-4137-0035.flac,HE WILL BRING A THOUSAND DOLLARS ANY DAY IN THE NEW ORLEANS MARKET REPLIED SMITH THEN YOU BET THE WHOLE OF THE BOY DO YOU YES I CALL YOU THEN SAID JOHNSON AT THE SAME TIME SPREADING HIS CARDS OUT UPON THE TABLE
32-4137-0036.flac,YOU HAVE BEAT ME SAID SMITH AS SOON AS HE SAW THE CARDS JERRY WHO WAS STANDING ON TOP OF THE TABLE WITH THE BANK NOTES AND SILVER DOLLARS ROUND HIS FEET WAS NOW ORDERED TO DESCEND FROM THE TABLE
32-4137-0037.flac,YOU WILL NOT FORGET THAT YOU BELONG TO ME SAID JOHNSON AS THE YOUNG SLAVE WAS STEPPING FROM THE TABLE TO A CHAIR NO SIR REPLIED THE CHATTEL
32-4137-0038.flac,YES SIR RESPONDED JERRY AS HE WIPED THE TEARS FROM HIS EYES SMITH TOOK FROM HIS POCKET THE BILL OF SALE AND HANDED IT TO JOHNSON AT THE SAME TIME SAYING
32-4137-0039.flac,I CLAIM THE RIGHT OF REDEEMING THAT BOY MISTER JOHNSON MY FATHER GAVE HIM TO ME WHEN I CAME OF AGE AND I PROMISED NOT TO PART WITH HIM MOST CERTAINLY SIR THE BOY SHALL BE YOURS WHENEVER YOU HAND ME OVER A COOL THOUSAND REPLIED JOHNSON
32-4137-0040.flac,THE NEXT MORNING AS THE PASSENGERS WERE ASSEMBLING IN THE BREAKFAST SALOONS AND UPON THE GUARDS OF THE VESSEL AND THE SERVANTS WERE SEEN RUNNING ABOUT WAITING UPON OR LOOKING FOR THEIR MASTERS POOR JERRY WAS ENTERING HIS NEW MASTER'S STATEROOM WITH HIS BOOTS
32-4137-0041.flac,WHO DO YOU BELONG TO SAID A GENTLEMAN TO AN OLD BLACK MAN
32-4137-0042.flac,WHEN I WENT TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT I BELONGED TO GOVERNOR LUCAS BUT I UNDERSTAND DAT HE IS BIN GAMBLING ALL NIGHT SO I DON'T KNOW WHO OWNS ME DIS MORNING SUCH IS THE UNCERTAINTY OF A SLAVE'S POSITION
32-4137-0043.flac,HE GOES TO BED AT NIGHT THE PROPERTY OF THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAS LIVED FOR YEARS AND GETS UP IN THE MORNING THE SLAVE OF SOME ONE WHOM HE HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE
32-4137-0044.flac,TO BEHOLD FIVE OR SIX TABLES IN A STEAMBOAT'S CABIN WITH HALF A DOZEN MEN PLAYING AT CARDS AND MONEY PISTOLS BOWIE KNIVES ALL IN CONFUSION ON THE TABLES IS WHAT MAY BE SEEN AT ALMOST ANY TIME ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER ON THE FOURTH DAY WHILE AT NATCHEZ
32-4137-0045.flac,TAKING IN FREIGHT AND PASSENGERS WALKER WHO HAD BEEN ON SHORE TO SEE SOME OF HIS OLD CUSTOMERS RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY A TALL THIN FACED MAN DRESSED IN BLACK WITH A WHITE NECKCLOTH WHICH IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED HIM TO BE A CLERGYMAN
32-4137-0046.flac,I WANT A GOOD TRUSTY WOMAN FOR HOUSE SERVICE SAID THE STRANGER AS THEY ENTERED THE CABIN WHERE WALKER'S SLAVES WERE KEPT HERE SHE IS AND NO MISTAKE REPLIED THE TRADER STAND UP CURRER MY GAL HERE'S A GENTLEMAN WHO WISHES TO SEE IF YOU WILL SUIT HIM

32-4137-0048.flac,I ONLY WANT ONE FOR MY OWN USE AND WOULD NOT NEED ANOTHER SAID THE MAN IN BLACK AS HE AND THE TRADER LEFT THE ROOM WALKER AND THE PARSON WENT INTO THE SALOON TALKED OVER THE MATTER THE BILL OF SALE WAS MADE OUT THE MONEY PAID OVER
32-4137-0049.flac,AND THE CLERGYMAN LEFT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE WOMAN SHOULD BE DELIVERED TO HIM AT HIS HOUSE IT SEEMED AS IF POOR ALTHESA WOULD HAVE WEPT HERSELF TO DEATH FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS AFTER HER MOTHER HAD BEEN TORN FROM HER SIDE BY THE HAND OF THE RUTHLESS TRAFFICKER IN HUMAN FLESH
32-4137-0050.flac,ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE BOAT AT BATON ROUGE AN ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF PASSENGERS WERE TAKEN ON BOARD AND AMONGST THEM SEVERAL PERSONS WHO HAD BEEN ATTENDING THE RACES GAMBLING AND DRINKING WERE NOW THE ORDER OF THE DAY
32-4137-0051.flac,WHICH CAUSED GREAT UNEASINESS TO THE LADIES AND TOOK THE GENTLEMEN TO THAT PART OF THE CABIN HOWEVER NOTHING SERIOUS HAD OCCURRED A MAN AT ONE OF THE TABLES WHERE THEY WERE GAMBLING HAD BEEN SEEN ATTEMPTING TO CONCEAL A CARD IN HIS SLEEVE
32-4137-0052.flac,AND ONE OF THE PARTY SEIZED HIS PISTOL AND FIRED BUT FORTUNATELY THE BARREL OF THE PISTOL WAS KNOCKED UP JUST AS IT WAS ABOUT TO BE DISCHARGED AND THE BALL PASSED THROUGH THE UPPER DECK INSTEAD OF THE MAN'S HEAD AS INTENDED ORDER WAS SOON RESTORED
32-4137-0053.flac,ALL WENT ON WELL THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY AT TEN O'CLOCK THE BOAT ARRIVED AT NEW ORLEANS
32-4137-0054.flac,OUR EYES ARE YET ON AFRIC'S SHORES HER THOUSAND WRONGS WE STILL DEPLORE WE SEE THE GRIM SLAVE TRADER THERE WE HEAR HIS FETTERED VICTIM'S PRAYER AND HASTEN TO THE SUFFERER'S AID

32-4137-0056.flac,THE KNAVE SHALL DIE THE LAW HATH SAID WHILE IT PROTECTS OUR OWN SLAVE TRADE WHAT EARTHLY EYE PRESUMES TO SCAN THE WILY PROTEUS HEART OF MAN WHAT POTENT HAND WILL E'ER UNROLL
32-4137-0057.flac,THE MANTLED TREACHERY OF HIS SOUL O WHERE IS HE WHO HATH SURVEYED THE HORRORS OF OUR OWN SLAVE TRADE THERE IS AN EYE THAT WAKES IN LIGHT THERE IS A HAND OF PEERLESS MIGHT WHICH SOON OR LATE
32-4137-0058.flac,SHALL YET ASSAIL AND REND DISSIMULATION'S VEIL
32-21634-0000.flac,THERE WAS GREAT REJOICING IN THE LITTLE VILLAGE IN THE POND WHEN BROWNIE BEAVER RETURNED WITH THE GOOD NEWS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE HUNTING AND FISHING AND WHEN OLD GRANDADDY BEAVER SAID THAT EVERYBODY OUGHT TO TAKE A HOLIDAY TO CELEBRATE THE OCCASION
32-21634-0001.flac,ALL THE VILLAGERS SAID IT WAS A FINE IDEA SO THEY STOPPED WORKING FOR ONCE AND BEGAN TO PLAN THE CELEBRATION THEY THOUGHT THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE SWIMMING RACES AND TREE FELLING CONTESTS
32-21634-0002.flac,AND BROWNIE BEAVER SAID THAT AFTER THE HOLIDAY WAS OVER HE WOULD SUGGEST THAT SOMEONE BE CHOSEN TO GO DOWN AND THANK FARMER GREEN FOR PUTTING THE NOTICE ON THE TREE THE WHOLE VILLAGE AGREED TO BROWNIE'S PROPOSAL
32-21634-0003.flac,BROWNIE BEAVER HIMSELF PASSED HIS HAT AROUND TO TAKE UP THE VOTES AND IT WAS QUICKLY FOUND THAT EVERY VOTE WAS FOR BROWNIE BEAVER HE HAD EVEN VOTED FOR HIMSELF BUT NO ONE SEEMED TO CARE ABOUT THAT
32-21634-0004.flac,AND ANOTHER IN WHICH EACH PERSON WHO TOOK PART HAD TO STAY BENEATH THE SURFACE AS LONG AS HE COULD THAT LAST RACE CAUSED SOME TROUBLE A YOUNG SCAMP CALLED SLIPPERY SAM WON IT AND MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD SWUM UP INSIDE HIS HOUSE
32-21634-0005.flac,WHERE HE COULD GET AIR WITHOUT BEING SEEN BUT NO ONE COULD PROVE IT SO HE WON THE RACE JUST THE SAME NEXT CAME THE TREE FELLING CONTEST THERE WERE SIX INCLUDING BROWNIE BEAVER THAT TOOK PART IN IT
32-21634-0006.flac,GRANDADDY BEAVER HAD PICKED OUT SIX TREES OF EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE EACH PERSON IN THE CONTEST HAD TO TRY TO BRING HIS TREE TO THE GROUND FIRST AND THAT CAUSED SOME TROUBLE TOO BECAUSE SOME CLAIMED THAT THEIR TREES WERE OF HARDER WOOD THAN OTHERS
32-21634-0007.flac,AND MORE DIFFICULT TO GNAW WHILE OTHERS COMPLAINED THAT THE BARK OF THEIR TREES TASTED VERY BITTER AND OF COURSE THAT MADE THEIR TASK UNPLEASANT THOSE SIX TREES FALLING ONE AFTER ANOTHER MADE SUCH A RACKET
32-21634-0008.flac,THAT OLD MISTER CROW HEARD THE NOISE MILES AWAY AND FLEW OVER TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AFTER EVERYBODY CREPT OUT OF HIS HIDING PLACE SOME TIME AFTERWARD EVERYONE HAD TO HIDE FOR A WHILE YOU KNOW
32-21634-0009.flac,THERE WAS MISTER CROW SITTING UPON ONE OF THE FALLEN TREES
32-21634-0010.flac,THEN THEY TOLD HIM ABOUT THE CELEBRATION AND MISTER CROW BEGAN TO LAUGH WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NEXT HE ASKED WE'RE A GOING TO SEND BROWNIE BEAVER OVER TO PLEASANT VALLEY
32-21634-0011.flac,TO THANK FARMER GREEN FOR HIS KINDNESS IN PUTTING AN END TO HUNTING AND FISHING SAID OLD GRANDADDY BEAVER AND HE'S A GOING TO START RIGHT AWAY MISTER CROW LOOKED AROUND AND THERE WAS BROWNIE BEAVER
32-21634-0012.flac,WITH A LUNCH BASKET IN HIS HAND ALL READY TO BEGIN HIS LONG JOURNEY SAY GOOD BY TO HIM THEN SAID MISTER CROW FOR YOU'LL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN GRANDADDY BEAVER ASKED
32-21634-0013.flac,AND AS FOR BROWNIE HE WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT HE DROPPED HIS BASKET RIGHT IN THE WATER I MEAN SAID MISTER CROW
32-21634-0014.flac,YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT SIGN IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WAS NOT FARMER GREEN BUT HIS SON JOHNNIE WHO NAILED IT TO THE TREE
32-21634-0015.flac,THAT IS WHY ONE OF THE WORDS WAS MISSPELLED NO DOUBT MISTER CROW REMARKED AS A MATTER OF FACT NOT BEING ABLE TO READ HE HADN'T KNOWN ABOUT THE WORD THAT WAS SPELLED WRONG IN THE SECOND PLACE HE CONTINUED
32-21634-0016.flac,THE SIGN DOESN'T MEAN THAT HUNTING AND FISHING ARE TO BE STOPPED IT MEANS THAT NO ONE BUT JOHNNIE GREEN IS GOING TO HUNT AND FISH IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
32-21634-0017.flac,AND INSTEAD OF HUNTING AND FISHING BEING STOPPED
32-21634-0018.flac,HE ADDED THAT JOHNNIE GREEN HAD A NEW GUN ON THIS BIRTHDAY BROWNIE BEAVER SAID AT ONCE THAT HE WAS NOT GOING ON THE ERRAND OF THANKS I RESIGN HE SAID AND ANYONE THAT WANTS TO GO IN MY PLACE IS WELCOME TO DO SO
32-21634-0019.flac,BUT NOBODY CARED TO GO AND THE WHOLE VILLAGE SEEMED GREATLY DISAPPOINTED UNTIL GRANDADDY BEAVER MADE A SHORT SPEECH
8226-274369-0000.flac,EVERY MEASURE PURSUED BY THE COMMONS
8226-274369-0001.flac,BESIDES NUMBERLESS VEXATIONS AND PERSECUTIONS WHICH THE CLERGY UNDERWENT FROM THE ARBITRARY POWER OF THE LOWER HOUSE THE PEERS WHILE THE KING WAS IN SCOTLAND
8226-274369-0002.flac,HAVING PASSED AN ORDER FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF THE LAWS WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC WORSHIP THE COMMONS ASSUMED SUCH AUTHORITY THAT BY A VOTE ALONE OF THEIR HOUSE THEY SUSPENDED THOSE LAWS THOUGH ENACTED BY THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE
8226-274369-0003.flac,THEY COMPLAINED OF THE KING'S FILLING FIVE VACANT SEES AND CONSIDERED IT AS AN INSULT UPON THEM
8226-274369-0004.flac,THEY MADE A DEMAND THE MOST ABSURD IN THE WORLD THAT THE BISHOPS BEING ALL OF THEM PARTIES SHOULD BE REFUSED A VOTE WITH REGARD TO THAT QUESTION AFTER THE RESOLUTION WAS ONCE FORMED BY THE COMMONS
8226-274369-0005.flac,OF INVADING THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT OF CHURCH AND STATE IT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED THAT THEIR PROCEEDINGS IN SUCH A VIOLENT ATTEMPT WOULD THENCEFORTH BE ALTOGETHER REGULAR AND EQUITABLE BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT
8226-274369-0006.flac,IN THEIR ATTACK ON THE HIERARCHY THEY STILL MORE OPENLY PASSED ALL BOUNDS OF MODERATION AS SUPPOSING NO DOUBT
8226-274369-0007.flac,HAD ALREADY RISEN TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND GAVE SUFFICIENT WARNING OF THEIR FUTURE ATTEMPTS UPON THAT ORDER THEY MUTTERED SOMEWHAT OF THEIR REGRET THAT THEY SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO SAVE THE KINGDOM ALONE
8226-274369-0008.flac,AND THAT THE HOUSE OF PEERS WOULD HAVE NO PART IN THE HONOR NAY THEY WENT SO FAR AS OPENLY TO TELL THE LORDS THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY OF THE WHOLE KINGDOM
8226-274369-0009.flac,AND THAT THE PEERS WERE NOTHING BUT INDIVIDUALS WHO HELD THEIR SEATS IN A PARTICULAR CAPACITY AND THEREFORE IF THEIR LORDSHIPS WILL NOT CONSENT TO THE PASSING OF ACTS NECESSARY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE PEOPLE THE COMMONS
8226-274369-0010.flac,TOGETHER WITH SUCH OF THE LORDS AS ARE MORE SENSIBLE OF THE DANGER MUST JOIN TOGETHER AND REPRESENT THE MATTER TO HIS MAJESTY SO VIOLENT WAS THE DEMOCRATICAL ENTHUSIASTIC SPIRIT DIFFUSED THROUGHOUT THE NATION
8226-274369-0011.flac,THAT A TOTAL CONFUSION OF ALL RANK AND ORDER WAS JUSTLY TO BE APPREHENDED AND THE WONDER WAS NOT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE NOBLES SHOULD SEEK SHELTER UNDER THE THRONE

8226-274369-0027.flac,WHICH WAS BEFORE SUFFICIENTLY PROVIDED WITH RELIGIOUS AS WELL AS CIVIL CAUSES OF QUARREL WAS ALSO SUPPLIED WITH PARTY NAMES UNDER WHICH THE FACTIONS MIGHT RENDEZVOUS AND SIGNALIZE THEIR MUTUAL HATRED
8226-274369-0028.flac,BEING DISTINGUISHABLE BY THEIR HABIT AND BEING THE OBJECT OF VIOLENT HATRED TO ALL THE SECTARIES WERE EXPOSED TO THE MOST DANGEROUS INSULTS WILLIAMS NOW CREATED ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

8226-274369-0030.flac,FOR THIS REASON THEY PROTESTED AGAINST ALL LAWS VOTES AND RESOLUTIONS AS NULL AND INVALID WHICH SHOULD PASS DURING THE TIME OF THEIR CONSTRAINED ABSENCE THIS PROTESTATION WHICH
8226-274369-0031.flac,THAT HOUSE DESIRED A CONFERENCE WITH THE COMMONS WHOM THEY INFORMED OF THIS UNEXPECTED PROTESTATION THE OPPORTUNITY WAS SEIZED WITH JOY AND TRIUMPH
8226-274369-0032.flac,THE KING WAS BETRAYED INTO ANOTHER INDISCRETION MUCH MORE FATAL AN INDISCRETION TO WHICH ALL THE ENSUING DISORDERS AND CIVIL WARS OUGHT IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY TO BE ASCRIBED
8226-274369-0033.flac,THIS WAS THE IMPEACHMENT OF LORD KIMBOLTON AND THE FIVE MEMBERS WHEN THE COMMONS EMPLOYED IN THEIR REMONSTRANCE LANGUAGE SO SEVERE AND INDECENT THEY HAD NOT BEEN ACTUATED ENTIRELY BY INSOLENCE AND PASSION
8226-274369-0034.flac,THEIR VIEWS WERE MORE SOLID AND PROFOUND THEY CONSIDERED THAT IN A VIOLENT ATTEMPT SUCH AS AN INVASION OF THE ANCIENT CONSTITUTION THE MORE LEISURE WAS AFFORDED THE PEOPLE TO REFLECT
8226-274369-0035.flac,THE LESS WOULD THEY BE INCLINED TO SECOND THAT RASH AND DANGEROUS ENTERPRISE THAT THE PEERS WOULD CERTAINLY REFUSE THEIR CONCURRENCE NOR WERE THERE ANY HOPES OF PREVAILING ON THEM BUT BY INSTIGATING THE POPULACE TO TUMULT AND DISORDER
8226-274369-0036.flac,THAT THE EMPLOYING OF SUCH ODIOUS MEANS FOR SO INVIDIOUS AN END WOULD AT LONG RUN LOSE THEM ALL THEIR POPULARITY AND TURN THE TIDE OF FAVOR TO THE CONTRARY PARTY AND THAT IF THE KING ONLY REMAINED IN TRANQUILLITY
8226-274369-0037.flac,THEY WERE THEREFORE RESOLVED IF POSSIBLE TO EXCITE HIM TO SOME VIOLENT PASSION
8226-274369-0038.flac,IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY SUCCEEDED BEYOND THEIR FONDEST WISHES CHARLES WAS ENRAGED TO FIND THAT ALL HIS CONCESSIONS BUT INCREASED THEIR DEMANDS
8226-274369-0039.flac,WERE AGAIN ROUSED TO SEDITION AND TUMULTS THAT THE BLACKEST CALUMNIES WERE PROPAGATED AGAINST HIM AND EVEN THE IRISH MASSACRE ASCRIBED TO HIS COUNSELS AND MACHINATIONS
8226-274369-0040.flac,HE WAS APT TO ASCRIBE THEM IN A GREAT MEASURE TO HIS OWN INDOLENCE AND FACILITY THE QUEEN AND THE LADIES OF THE COURT FURTHER STIMULATED HIS PASSION AND REPRESENTED THAT
8226-274369-0041.flac,IF HE EXERTED THE VIGOR AND DISPLAYED THE MAJESTY OF A MONARCH THE DARING USURPATIONS OF HIS SUBJECTS WOULD SHRINK BEFORE HIM LORD DIGBY A MAN OF FINE PARTS BUT FULL OF LEVITY AND HURRIED ON BY PRECIPITATE PASSIONS
8226-274369-0042.flac,THAT THEY HAD TRAITOROUSLY ENDEAVORED TO SUBVERT THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS AND GOVERNMENT OF THE KINGDOM TO DEPRIVE THE KING OF HIS REGAL POWER AND TO IMPOSE ON HIS SUBJECTS AN ARBITRARY AND TYRANNICAL AUTHORITY THAT THEY HAD ENDEAVORED
8226-274369-0043.flac,BY MANY FOUL ASPERSIONS ON HIS MAJESTY AND HIS GOVERNMENT TO ALIENATE THE AFFECTIONS OF HIS PEOPLE AND MAKE HIM ODIOUS TO THEM THAT THEY HAD ATTEMPTED TO DRAW HIS LATE ARMY TO DISOBEDIENCE OF HIS ROYAL COMMANDS
8226-274369-0044.flac,AND TO SIDE WITH THEM IN THEIR TRAITOROUS DESIGNS
8226-274369-0045.flac,SEEM TO BE COMMON BETWEEN THE IMPEACHED MEMBERS AND THE PARLIAMENT
8226-274369-0046.flac,THAN SO FAR AS THEY CONCURRED WITH THE MAJORITY IN THEIR VOTES AND SPEECHES THOUGH PROOFS MIGHT PERHAPS BE PRODUCED OF THEIR PRIVATELY INVITING THE SCOTS TO INVADE ENGLAND
8226-274369-0047.flac,HOW COULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE CONSIDERED AS TREASON AFTER THE ACT OF OBLIVION WHICH HAD PASSED AND AFTER THAT BOTH HOUSES WITH THE KING'S CONCURRENCE HAD VOTED THAT NATION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS FOR THEIR BROTHERLY ASSISTANCE
8226-274369-0048.flac,WHILE THE HOUSE OF PEERS ARE SCARCELY ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCY OR TO REJECT THE BILLS SENT THEM BY THE COMMONS WILL THEY EVER BE PERMITTED BY THE POPULACE SUPPOSING THEM INCLINED
8226-274369-0049.flac,BUT SURELY WAS NEVER BEFORE ATTEMPTED IN OPPOSITION TO A FACTION DURING THE FULL TIDE OF ITS POWER AND SUCCESS BUT MEN HAD NOT LEISURE TO WONDER AT THE INDISCRETION OF THIS MEASURE

8226-274369-0062.flac,AND THAT HE HAD ACCUSED CERTAIN MEN OF HIGH TREASON AGAINST WHOM HE WOULD PROCEED IN A LEGAL WAY AND THEREFORE PRESUMED THAT THEY WOULD NOT MEET WITH PROTECTION IN THE CITY AFTER MANY OTHER GRACIOUS EXPRESSIONS

8226-274371-0004.flac,THAT THOSE WHO ADVISED HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER WERE ENEMIES TO THE STATE AND MISCHIEVOUS PROJECTORS AGAINST THE SAFETY OF THE NATION THAT THIS DENIAL IS OF SUCH DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCE THAT IF HIS MAJESTY PERSIST IN IT
8226-274371-0005.flac,IT WILL HAZARD THE PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY OF ALL HIS KINGDOMS UNLESS SOME SPEEDY REMEDY BE APPLIED BY THE WISDOM AND AUTHORITY OF BOTH HOUSES AND THAT SUCH OF THE SUBJECTS AS HAVE PUT THEMSELVES IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE AGAINST THE COMMON DANGER

8226-274371-0008.flac,HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO OPEN THE EYES OF MANY AND TO RECOVER THEM FROM THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH AT FIRST THEY HAD BEEN SEIZED
8226-274371-0009.flac,AND THEY PROCEEDED TO FRAME AN ORDINANCE IN WHICH BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE TWO HOUSES WITHOUT THE KING'S CONSENT THEY NAMED LIEUTENANTS FOR ALL THE COUNTIES AND CONFERRED ON THEM THE COMMAND OF THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE OF ALL THE GUARDS
8226-274371-0010.flac,GARRISONS AND FORTS OF THE KINGDOM HE ISSUED PROCLAMATIONS AGAINST THIS MANIFEST USURPATION
8226-274371-0011.flac,AS HE PROFESSED A RESOLUTION STRICTLY TO OBSERVE THE LAW HIMSELF SO WAS HE DETERMINED HE SAID TO OBLIGE EVERY OTHER PERSON TO PAY IT A LIKE OBEDIENCE THE NAME OF THE KING WAS SO ESSENTIAL TO ALL LAWS
8226-274371-0012.flac,AND SO FAMILIAR IN ALL ACTS OF EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS AFRAID HAD THEY TOTALLY OMITTED IT THAT THE INNOVATION WOULD BE TOO SENSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE IN ALL COMMANDS THEREFORE WHICH THEY CONFERRED
8226-274371-0013.flac,THEY BOUND THE PERSONS TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF HIS MAJESTY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND INVENTING A DISTINCTION HITHERTO UNHEARD OF BETWEEN THE OFFICE AND THE PERSON OF THE KING
8226-274371-0014.flac,THOSE VERY FORCES WHICH THEY EMPLOYED AGAINST HIM THEY LEVIED IN HIS NAME AND BY HIS AUTHORITY IT IS REMARKABLE HOW MUCH THE TOPICS OF ARGUMENT WERE NOW REVERSED BETWEEN THE PARTIES THE KING
8226-274371-0015.flac,WHILE HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERROR OF EMPLOYING A PLEA OF NECESSITY IN ORDER TO INFRINGE THE LAWS AND CONSTITUTION WARNED THE PARLIAMENT NOT TO IMITATE AN EXAMPLE ON WHICH THEY THREW SUCH VIOLENT BLAME AND THE PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0016.flac,WHILE THEY CLOTHED THEIR PERSONAL FEARS OR AMBITION UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF NATIONAL AND IMMINENT DANGER MADE UNKNOWINGLY AN APOLOGY FOR THE MOST EXCEPTIONABLE PART OF THE KING'S CONDUCT
8226-274371-0017.flac,THAT THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE WERE NO LONGER EXPOSED TO ANY PERIL FROM ROYAL AUTHORITY SO NARROWLY CIRCUMSCRIBED SO EXACTLY DEFINED

8226-274371-0025.flac,BY COMPARISON TO FORM A JUDGMENT BETWEEN THEM THE PARLIAMENT WHILE THEY DISTRIBUTED COPIES OF THEIR OWN WERE ANXIOUS TO SUPPRESS ALL THE KING'S COMPOSITIONS
8226-274371-0026.flac,TO THE ORDINANCE OF THE PARLIAMENT CONCERNING THE MILITIA THE KING OPPOSED HIS COMMISSIONS OF ARRAY THE COUNTIES OBEYED THE ONE OR THE OTHER ACCORDING AS THEY STOOD AFFECTED AND IN MANY COUNTIES WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE DIVIDED

8226-274371-0038.flac,THEIR OWN MEMBERS ALSO WHO SHOULD RETURN TO THEM THEY VOTED NOT TO ADMIT TILL SATISFIED CONCERNING THE REASON OF THEIR ABSENCE CHARLES MADE A DECLARATION TO THE PEERS WHO ATTENDED HIM
8226-274371-0039.flac,THAT HE EXPECTED FROM THEM NO OBEDIENCE TO ANY COMMANDS WHICH WERE NOT WARRANTED BY THE LAWS OF THE LAND THE PEERS ANSWERED THIS DECLARATION BY A PROTEST
8226-274371-0040.flac,IN ORDER TO REMOVE ALL JEALOUSY HE HAD RESOLVED THAT THEIR USURPATIONS AND ILLEGAL PRETENSIONS SHOULD BE APPARENT TO THE WHOLE WORLD AND THOUGHT THAT TO RECOVER THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE WAS A POINT MUCH MORE MATERIAL TO HIS INTEREST
8226-274371-0041.flac,THAN THE COLLECTING OF ANY MAGAZINES STORES OR ARMIES WHICH MIGHT BREED APPREHENSIONS OF VIOLENT OR ILLEGAL COUNSELS BUT THE URGENT NECESSITY OF HIS SITUATION NO LONGER ADMITTED OF DELAY
8226-274371-0042.flac,HE NOW PREPARED HIMSELF FOR DEFENCE WITH A SPIRIT ACTIVITY AND ADDRESS

8425-287387-0015.flac,AND CAUSED THEM TO BURST ASUNDER AND SHAKE AND TREMBLE FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR WISTFUL AFTERMATH OF BEAUTY THEN HIS EYES GREW MOIST HIS HEART BECAME MORE FULL THAN HE COULD BEAR
8425-287387-0016.flac,AND HE WENT AWAY THROUGH THE ARCH OF TITUS BY THE COLOSSEUM THROUGH THE ARCH OF CONSTANTINE
8425-287387-0017.flac,NEITHER IN HIS MOTHER NOR IN HIS SISTERS DID HE FIND A STRAIN THAT SYMPATHIZED WITH HIS ECCENTRIC TENDENCIES AND SINCE THAT ONE FRIEND WHO DIED HE HAD NEVER FOUND ANOTHER AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN LONELY WITHIN
8425-287387-0018.flac,AND WITHOUT AS THOUGH THE VICTIM OF A PREDESTINATION WHICH WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO MEET WITH SYMPATHY BUT HE HAD PEOPLED HIS LONELINESS SO DENSELY WITH HIS DREAMS THAT HE HAD NEVER FELT UNHAPPY BECAUSE OF IT
8425-287387-0019.flac,AND EVEN AS HE LOVED ROAMING ALONE AMONG THE RUINS AND ALONG THE COUNTRY ROADS SO HE CHERISHED THE PRIVACY OF HIS LONELY STUDIO WITH THE MANY SILENT FIGURES ON AN OLD PANEL OF SOME TRIPTYCH
8425-287387-0020.flac,ON A TAPESTRY OR ON THE MANY CLOSELY HUNG SKETCHES ALL AROUND HIM ALL WITH THE CHARM OF THEIR LINES
8425-287387-0021.flac,OR A SHADOWY ANTIQUE CABINET AND IN BETWEEN ALL THIS LIVED HIS CHINA AND BRONZE AND OLD SILVER WHILE THE FADED GOLD EMBROIDERY OF AN ECCLESIASTICAL VESTMENT GLEAMED FAINTLY
8425-287387-0022.flac,AND THE OLD LEATHER BINDINGS OF HIS BOOKS STOOD IN COMFORTABLE BROWN ROWS READY TO GIVE FORTH WHEN HIS HANDS OPENED THEM IMAGES WHICH MISTILY DRIFTED UPWARDS LIVING THEIR LOVES AND THEIR SORROWS IN THE TEMPERED BROWNS AND REDS AND GOLDS
8425-287387-0023.flac,OF THE SOUNDLESS ATMOSPHERE OF THE STUDIO SUCH WAS HIS SIMPLE LIFE WITHOUT MUCH INWARD DOUBTING BECAUSE HE MADE NO GREAT DEMANDS UPON HIMSELF AND WITHOUT THE MODERN ARTIST'S MELANCHOLY
8425-287387-0024.flac,BEING BY NATURE A LITTLE SHY OF BAEDEKERED TOURISTS OF SHORT SKIRTED ENGLISH LADIES WITH THEIR PERSISTENT LITTLE EXCLAMATIONS OF UNIFORM ADMIRATION AND FEELING ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE IN THE HALF ITALIAN
8425-287387-0025.flac,HALF COSMOPOLITAN SET OF HIS RATHER WORLDLY MOTHER AND SMART LITTLE SISTERS WHO SPENT THEIR TIME DANCING AND CYCLING WITH YOUNG ITALIAN PRINCES AND DUKES
8425-287387-0026.flac,AND AGAIN UNTIL IN HIS MUSING HE SEEMED TO HEAR IT ONCE MORE ON HER OWN LIPS UNTIL SHE JOINED THE BUSTS AND TORSOS IN HIS STUDIO AND APPEARED BEFORE HIM IN THE LILY LIKE FRAILNESS OF HER VISIBLE ACTUALITY
8425-287387-0027.flac,AGAINST THE PRERAPHAELITE STIFFNESS OF LINE
8425-287387-0028.flac,HIS LIFE HAD NEVER KNOWN MORE THAN THE NATURAL VIRILE IMPULSE AND THE ORDINARY LITTLE LOVE AFFAIR WITH A MODEL
8425-287387-0029.flac,AND UNREAL BALANCE BETWEEN A WOMAN WHO SHOWED HERSELF IN THE NUDE FOR A FEW LIRE AND PETRARCH'S LAURA
8425-287387-0030.flac,AND PREGNANT SENSE OF THE WORD AND WHEN HE BEGAN TO THINK AND TO THINK LONG AND OFTEN OF CORNELIE DE RETZ
8425-287387-0031.flac,AND DREAMED FOR DAYS FOR A WEEK ABOUT A WOMAN IN A POEM
8425-287387-0032.flac,NEVER AND THAT HE IRRITATED BY SOME OF HER SAYINGS HAD NEVERTHELESS SEEN HER STAND WITH HER LILY LIKE OUTLINE
8425-292520-0000.flac,THE BRIDGE THE LONELY BRIDGE CUTS DARK ACROSS THE MARSH
8425-292520-0001.flac,PALELY REFLECTED IN THE AMBER COLORED WATER AMONG THEM A CONSTANT BANJO TWANGING OF FROGS AND SHRILLING

8425-291444-0000.flac,OF THIS VENERABLE AND ANCIENT CITY GRADUALLY SLIPPING FROM OUR GRASP TREMBLING ON THE LIPS OF NARRATIVE OLD AGE AND DAY BY DAY DROPPING PIECEMEAL INTO THE TOMB IN A LITTLE WHILE THOUGHT I AND THOSE REVERED DUTCH BURGHERS
8425-291444-0001.flac,WHO SERVE AS THE TOTTERING MONUMENTS OF GOOD OLD TIMES WILL BE GATHERED TO THEIR FATHERS THEIR CHILDREN ENGROSSED BY THE EMPTY PLEASURES OR INSIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS OF THE PRESENT AGE WILL NEGLECT TO TREASURE UP THE RECOLLECTIONS OF THE PAST
8425-291444-0002.flac,AND POSTERITY WILL SEARCH IN VAIN FOR MEMORIALS OF THE DAYS OF THE PATRIARCHS THE ORIGIN OF OUR CITY WILL BE BURIED IN ETERNAL OBLIVION AND EVEN THE NAMES AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF WOUTER VAN TWILLER
8425-291444-0003.flac,STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THOUGH SUCH MULTITUDES OF EXCELLENT WORKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THIS COUNTRY THERE ARE NONE EXTANT WHICH GIVE ANY FULL AND SATISFACTORY ACCOUNT OF THE EARLY HISTORY OF NEW YORK
8425-291444-0004.flac,OR OF ITS THREE FIRST DUTCH GOVERNORS I HAVE HOWEVER GAINED MUCH VALUABLE AND CURIOUS MATTER FROM AN ELABORATE MANUSCRIPT WRITTEN
8425-291444-0005.flac,EXCEPTING A FEW ERRORS IN ORTHOGRAPHY WHICH WAS FOUND IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE STUYVESANT FAMILY MANY LEGENDS LETTERS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS HAVE I LIKEWISE GLEANED IN MY RESEARCHES AMONG THE FAMILY CHESTS AND LUMBER GARRETS OF OUR RESPECTABLE
8425-291444-0006.flac,BY THAT ADMIRABLE AND PRAISEWORTHY INSTITUTION THE NEW YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY TO WHICH I HERE PUBLICLY RETURN MY SINCERE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS IN THE CONDUCT OF THIS INESTIMABLE WORK I HAVE ADOPTED NO INDIVIDUAL MODEL
8425-291444-0007.flac,AND THE STRICTEST ADHERENCE TO TRUTH THROUGHOUT MY HISTORY I HAVE ENRICHED IT AFTER THE MANNER OF SALLUST WITH VARIOUS CHARACTERS OF ANCIENT WORTHIES DRAWN AT FULL LENGTH AND FAITHFULLY COLORED
8425-291444-0008.flac,SWEETENED IT WITH THE GRACES OF SENTIMENT LIKE TACITUS AND INFUSED INTO THE WHOLE THE DIGNITY THE GRANDEUR AND MAGNIFICENCE OF LIVY I AM AWARE THAT I SHALL INCUR THE CENSURE OF NUMEROUS VERY LEARNED AND JUDICIOUS CRITICS FOR
8425-291444-0009.flac,OF THE HISTORIAN AND ENTICE HIM TO TURN ASIDE AND REFRESH HIMSELF FROM HIS WAYFARING BUT I TRUST IT WILL BE FOUND THAT I HAVE ALWAYS RESUMED MY STAFF AND ADDRESSED MYSELF TO MY WEARY JOURNEY WITH RENOVATED SPIRITS
8425-291444-0010.flac,YET THE LOOSE AND UNCONNECTED MANNER IN WHICH MANY OF THE FACTS HEREIN RECORDED HAVE COME TO HAND RENDERED SUCH AN ATTEMPT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT THIS DIFFICULTY WAS LIKEWISE INCREASED BY ONE OF THE GRAND OBJECTS CONTEMPLATED IN MY WORK
8425-291444-0011.flac,BUT THE CHIEF MERIT ON WHICH I VALUE MYSELF AND FOUND MY HOPES FOR FUTURE REGARD IS THAT FAITHFUL VERACITY WITH WHICH I HAVE COMPILED THIS INVALUABLE LITTLE WORK
8425-291444-0012.flac,CAREFULLY WINNOWING AWAY THE CHAFF OF HYPOTHESIS AND DISCARDING THE TARES OF FABLE WHICH ARE TOO APT TO SPRING UP AND CHOKE THE SEEDS OF TRUTH AND WHOLESOME KNOWLEDGE HAD I BEEN ANXIOUS TO CAPTIVATE THE SUPERFICIAL THRONG
8425-291444-0013.flac,THE INFANT YEARS OF OUR CITY TO INTRODUCE A THOUSAND PLEASING FICTIONS BUT I HAVE SCRUPULOUSLY DISCARDED MANY A PITHY TALE AND MARVELOUS ADVENTURE WHEREBY THE DROWSY EAR OF SUMMER INDOLENCE MIGHT BE ENTHRALLED
8425-291444-0014.flac,JEALOUSLY MAINTAINING THAT FIDELITY GRAVITY AND DIGNITY WHICH SHOULD EVER DISTINGUISH THE HISTORIAN FOR A WRITER OF THIS CLASS OBSERVES AN ELEGANT CRITIC MUST SUSTAIN THE CHARACTER OF A WISE MAN WRITING FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF POSTERITY
8425-291444-0015.flac,TO DECAY WHO GATHERS TOGETHER THEIR SCATTERED FRAGMENTS AS THEY ROT AND WHO PIOUSLY AT LENGTH COLLECTS THEIR ASHES INTO THE MAUSOLEUM OF HIS WORK AND REARS A TRIUMPHANT MONUMENT
8425-291444-0016.flac,TO TRANSMIT THEIR RENOWN TO ALL SUCCEEDING AGES WHAT HAS BEEN THE FATE OF MANY FAIR CITIES OF ANTIQUITY WHOSE NAMELESS RUINS ENCUMBER THE PLAINS OF EUROPE AND ASIA AND AWAKEN THE FRUITLESS INQUIRY OF THE TRAVELER
8425-291444-0017.flac,THEY HAVE PERISHED FROM REMEMBRANCE FOR WANT OF A HISTORIAN THE PHILANTHROPIST MAY WEEP OVER THEIR DESOLATION THE POET MAY WANDER AMONG THEIR MOULDERING ARCHES AND BROKEN COLUMNS
8425-291444-0018.flac,AND INDULGE THE VISIONARY FLIGHTS OF HIS FANCY BUT ALAS ALAS THE MODERN HISTORIAN WHOSE PEN LIKE MY OWN IS DOOMED TO CONFINE ITSELF TO DULL MATTER OF FACT
8425-291444-0019.flac,REUNITE THE THREAD OF GENERATIONS THE SAME SAD MISFORTUNE WHICH HAS HAPPENED TO SO MANY ANCIENT CITIES WILL HAPPEN AGAIN AND FROM THE SAME SAD CAUSE TO NINE TENTHS OF THOSE WHICH NOW FLOURISH ON THE FACE OF THE GLOBE
8425-246962-0000.flac,BEFORE THE MORNING LEOPOLD LAY WOUND IN THE NET OF A LOW FEVER ALMOST AS ILL AS EVER BUT WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT HIS MIND WAS FAR LESS TROUBLED AND THAT EVEN HIS MOST RESTLESS DREAMS
8425-246962-0001.flac,TO THE FINAL EXECUTION OF THE LAW SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD FOLLOW IT ALL IN HIS MOVEMENTS AND THE EXPRESSIONS OF HIS COUNTENANCE AT A CERTAIN POINT THE COLD DEW ALWAYS APPEARED ON HIS FOREHEAD
8425-246962-0002.flac,TALKING FACE TO FACE WITH JESUS
8425-246962-0003.flac,WAS AMAZING IN ITS BEAUTY FOR HELEN HERSELF SHE WAS PREY TO A HOST OF CHANGEFUL EMOTIONS AT ONE TIME SHE ACCUSED HERSELF BITTERLY OF HAVING BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE RETURN OF HIS ILLNESS
8425-246962-0004.flac,THE NEXT A GUSH OF GLADNESS WOULD SWELL HER HEART AT THE THOUGHT THAT NOW SHE HAD HIM AT LEAST SAFER FOR A WHILE AND THAT HE MIGHT DIE AND SO ESCAPE THE WHOLE CROWD OF HORRIBLE POSSIBILITIES
8425-246962-0005.flac,FOR GEORGE'S MANIPULATION OF THE MAGISTRATE COULD BUT DELAY THE DISCLOSURE OF THE TRUTH EVEN SHOULD NO DISCOVERY BE MADE LEOPOLD MUST AT LENGTH SUSPECT A TRICK AND THAT WOULD AT ONCE DRIVE HIM TO FRESH ACTION
8425-246962-0006.flac,BUT AMONGST THE REST A FEELING WHICH HAD BUT LATELY BEGUN TO INDICATE ITS FAR OFF PRESENCE NOW THREATENED TO BRING WITH IT A DEEPER AND MORE PERMANENT SORROW IT BECAME MORE AND MORE PLAIN TO HER
8425-246962-0007.flac,THAT SHE HAD TAKEN THE EVIL PART AGAINST THE ONE SHE LOVED BEST IN THE WORLD THAT SHE HAD BEEN AS A SATAN TO HIM HAD DRIVEN HIM BACK STOOD ALMOST BODILY IN THE WAY TO TURN HIM FROM THE PATH OF PEACE
8425-246962-0008.flac,WHILE SHE FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF SHAME AND PITY FOR THE SAKE OF THE FAMILY AS SHE HAD SAID TO HERSELF HAD PURSUED A COURSE WHICH IF SUCCESSFUL WOULD AT BEST HAVE RESULTED IN SHUTTING HIM UP AS IN A MADHOUSE
8425-246962-0009.flac,WITH HIS OWN INBORN HORRORS WITH VAIN REMORSE AND EQUALLY VAIN LONGING HER CONSCIENCE NOW THAT HER MIND WAS QUIETER FROM THE GREATER DISTANCE TO WHICH THE THREATENING PERIL HAD AGAIN WITHDRAWN
8425-246962-0010.flac,WITHOUT COMMITTING THE SUICIDE OF SURRENDER SHE COULD NOT SEE THAT CONFESSION WAS THE VERY DOOR OF REFUGE AND SAFETY TOWARDS WHICH HE MUST PRESS GEORGE'S ABSENCE WAS NOW AGAIN A RELIEF
8425-246962-0011.flac,AND WHILE SHE FEARED AND SHRANK FROM THE SEVERITY OF WINGFOLD SHE COULD NOT HELP A CERTAIN INDISCRIBABLE SENSE OF SAFETY IN HIS PRESENCE AT LEAST SO LONG AS LEOPOLD WAS TOO ILL TO TALK FOR THE CURATE
8425-246962-0012.flac,HE BECAME MORE AND MORE INTERESTED IN THE WOMAN WHO COULD LOVE SO STRONGLY AND YET NOT ENTIRELY WHO SUFFERED AND MUST STILL SUFFER SO MUCH AND WHO A FAITH EVEN NO GREATER THAN HIS OWN MIGHT RENDER COMPARATIVELY BLESSED
8425-246962-0013.flac,BUT TO SO MANY OF THE SECRET CHAMBERS OF THE SOULS OF THE CONGREGATION FOR WHAT A MAN DARES NOT COULD NOT IF HE DARED AND DARED NOT IF HE COULD SAY TO ANOTHER EVEN AT THE TIME AND IN THE PLACE FITTEST OF ALL
8425-246962-0014.flac,HE CAN SAY THENCE OPEN FACED BEFORE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION AND THE PERSON IN NEED THEREOF MAY HEAR IT WITHOUT UMBRAGE OR THE CHOKING HUSK OF INDIVIDUAL APPLICATION IRRITATING TO THE REJECTION OF WHAT TRUTH MAY LIE IN IT FOR HIM
8425-246962-0015.flac,THEN WOULD MEN SOON UNDERSTAND THAT NOT THE FORM OF EVEN SOUNDEST WORDS AVAILETH ANYTHING BUT A NEW CREATURE WHEN WINGFOLD WAS IN THE PULPIT THEN HE COULD SPEAK AS FROM THE SECRET TO THE SECRET BUT ELSEWHERE HE FELT
8425-246962-0016.flac,IN REGARD TO HELEN LIKE A TRANSPORT SHIP FILLED WITH TROOPS WHICH MUST GO SAILING AROUND THE SHORES OF AN INVADED ALLY
8425-246962-0017.flac,IS IT AN INFIRMITY OF CERTAIN KINDS OF MEN OR A WISE PROVISION FOR THEIR PROTECTION THAT THE BRIGHTEST FORMS THE TRUTH TAKES IN THEIR PRIVATE COGITATIONS SEEM TO LOSE HALF THEIR LUSTRE
8425-246962-0018.flac,AND ALL THEIR GRACE WHEN UTTERED IN THE PRESENCE OF AN UNRECEPTIVE NATURE AND THEY HEAR AS IT WERE THEIR OWN VOICE REFLECTED IN A POOR DULL INHARMONIOUS ECHO AND ARE DISGUSTED BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
8425-246962-0019.flac,OR MISSING HIM GLOOMED BACK INTO THE LAND OF VISIONS THE TENDERNESS OF THE CURATE'S SERVICE THE HEART THAT SHOWED ITSELF IN EVERYTHING HE DID EVEN IN THE TURN AND EXPRESSION OF THE MINISTERING HAND
8425-246962-0020.flac,WAS A KIND OF REVELATION TO HELEN FOR WHILE HIS INTELLECT WAS HANGING ABOUT THE DOOR ASKING QUESTIONS AND UNEASILY SHIFTING HITHER AND THITHER IN ITS UNLOVED PERPLEXITIES
8425-246962-0021.flac,HAD HE NOT GONE FARTHER THAN HIS RIGHT HAD HE NOT IMPLIED MORE CONVICTION THAN WAS HIS WORDS COULD NOT GO BEYOND HIS SATISFACTION WITH WHAT HE FOUND IN THE GOSPEL OR THE HOPES FOR THE RANGE OF HIS
8425-246962-0022.flac,CONSCIOUS LIFE SPRINGING THEREFROM BUT WAS HE NOT NOW MAKING PEOPLE SUPPOSE HIM MORE CERTAIN OF THE FACT OF THESE THINGS THAN HE WAS
8425-246962-0023.flac,EVEN IF HE HAD BEEN SO CARRIED AWAY BY THE DELIGHT OF HIS HEART AS TO GIVE SUCH AN IMPRESSION IT MATTERED LITTLE WHAT WAS IT TO OTHER PEOPLE WHAT HE BELIEVED OR HOW HE BELIEVED IF HE HAD NOT BEEN UNTRUE TO HIMSELF
8425-246962-0024.flac,NO HARM WOULD FOLLOW WAS A MAN NEVER TO TALK FROM THE HIGHEST IN HIM TO THE FORGETTING OF THE LOWER WAS A MAN NEVER TO BE CARRIED BEYOND HIMSELF AND THE REGIONS OF HIS KNOWLEDGE IF SO THEN FAREWELL POETRY AND PROPHECY
8425-246962-0025.flac,YEA ALL GRAND DISCOVERY FOR THINGS MUST BE FORESEEN ERE THEY CAN BE REALIZED APPREHENDED ERE THEY BE COMPREHENDED THIS MUCH HE COULD SAY FOR HIMSELF AND NO MORE THAT HE WAS READY TO LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR THE MERE CHANCE
8425-246962-0026.flac,BUT TO THE TRUTH TO THE LOVELINESS AND HARMONY AND RIGHTEOUSNESS AND SAFETY THAT HE SAW IN THE IDEA OF THE SON OF MAN AS HE READ IT IN THE STORY HE DARED NOT SAY WHAT IN A TIME OF PERSECUTION TORTURE MIGHT WORK UPON HIM
8425-246962-0027.flac,BUT HE FELT RIGHT HOPEFUL THAT EVEN WERE HE BASE ENOUGH TO DENY HIM ANY COCK MIGHT CROW HIM BACK TO REPENTANCE AT THE SAME TIME HE SAW PLAIN ENOUGH THAT EVEN IF HE GAVE HIS BODY TO BE BURNED
8425-246962-0028.flac,NOTHING COULD SATISFY HIM OF THAT LESS THAN THE CONSCIOUS PRESENCE OF THE PERFECT CHARITY WITHOUT THAT HE WAS STILL OUTSIDE THE KINGDOM WANDERING IN A DREAM AROUND ITS WALLS
8425-246962-0029.flac,AND WITH EVERY FRESH CONFLICT EVERY FRESH GLEAM OF DOUBTFUL VICTORY THE ESSENTIAL IDEA OF THE MASTER LOOKED MORE AND MORE LOVELY AND HE BEGAN TO SEE THE WORKING OF HIS DOUBTS ON THE GROWTH OF HIS HEART AND SOUL
8425-246962-0030.flac,HE HAD MUCH TIME FOR REFLECTION AS HE SAT SILENT BY THE BEDSIDE OF LEOPOLD SOMETIMES HELEN WOULD BE SITTING NEAR THOUGH GENERALLY WHEN HE ARRIVED SHE WENT OUT FOR HER WALK BUT NEVER ANYTHING CAME TO HIM HE COULD UTTER TO HER
89-218-0000.flac,CHAPTER TWENTY ONE A MOMENT'S GLANCE WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY CATHERINE THAT HER APARTMENT WAS VERY UNLIKE THE ONE WHICH HENRY HAD ENDEAVOURED TO ALARM HER BY THE DESCRIPTION OF IT WAS BY NO MEANS UNREASONABLY LARGE AND CONTAINED NEITHER TAPESTRY NOR VELVET
89-218-0001.flac,THE WALLS WERE PAPERED THE FLOOR WAS CARPETED THE WINDOWS WERE NEITHER LESS PERFECT NOR MORE DIM THAN THOSE OF THE DRAWING ROOM BELOW THE FURNITURE THOUGH NOT OF THE LATEST FASHION WAS HANDSOME AND COMFORTABLE AND THE AIR OF THE ROOM ALTOGETHER FAR FROM UNCHEERFUL
89-218-0002.flac,HER HEART INSTANTANEOUSLY AT EASE ON THIS POINT SHE RESOLVED TO LOSE NO TIME IN PARTICULAR EXAMINATION OF ANYTHING AS SHE GREATLY DREADED DISOBLIGING THE GENERAL BY ANY DELAY
89-218-0003.flac,AND SHE WAS PREPARING TO UNPIN THE LINEN PACKAGE WHICH THE CHAISE SEAT HAD CONVEYED FOR HER IMMEDIATE ACCOMMODATION WHEN HER EYE SUDDENLY FELL ON A LARGE HIGH CHEST STANDING BACK IN A DEEP RECESS ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE THE SIGHT OF IT MADE HER START
89-218-0004.flac,AND FORGETTING EVERYTHING ELSE SHE STOOD GAZING ON IT IN MOTIONLESS WONDER WHILE THESE THOUGHTS CROSSED HER
89-218-0005.flac,PUSHED BACK TOO AS IF MEANT TO BE OUT OF SIGHT I WILL LOOK INTO IT COST ME WHAT IT MAY I WILL LOOK INTO IT AND DIRECTLY TOO BY DAYLIGHT IF I STAY TILL EVENING MY CANDLE MAY GO OUT SHE ADVANCED AND EXAMINED IT CLOSELY
89-218-0006.flac,IT WAS OF CEDAR CURIOUSLY INLAID WITH SOME DARKER WOOD AND RAISED ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE GROUND ON A CARVED STAND OF THE SAME THE LOCK WAS SILVER THOUGH TARNISHED FROM AGE
89-218-0007.flac,BROKEN PERHAPS PREMATURELY BY SOME STRANGE VIOLENCE AND ON THE CENTRE OF THE LID WAS A MYSTERIOUS CIPHER IN THE SAME METAL CATHERINE BENT OVER IT INTENTLY BUT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING WITH CERTAINTY SHE COULD NOT IN WHATEVER DIRECTION SHE TOOK IT
89-218-0008.flac,BELIEVE THE LAST LETTER TO BE A T AND YET THAT IT SHOULD BE ANYTHING ELSE IN THAT HOUSE WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO RAISE NO COMMON DEGREE OF ASTONISHMENT IF NOT ORIGINALLY THEIRS BY WHAT STRANGE EVENTS COULD IT HAVE FALLEN INTO THE TILNEY FAMILY HER FEARFUL CURIOSITY
89-218-0009.flac,WAS EVERY MOMENT GROWING GREATER AND SEIZING WITH TREMBLING HANDS THE HASP OF THE LOCK SHE RESOLVED AT ALL HAZARDS TO SATISFY HERSELF AT LEAST AS TO ITS CONTENTS WITH DIFFICULTY FOR SOMETHING SEEMED TO RESIST HER EFFORTS SHE RAISED THE LID A FEW INCHES
89-218-0010.flac,BUT AT THAT MOMENT A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM MADE HER STARTING QUIT HER HOLD AND THE LID CLOSED WITH ALARMING VIOLENCE THIS ILL TIMED INTRUDER WAS MISS TILNEY'S MAID SENT BY HER MISTRESS TO BE OF USE TO MISS MORLAND AND THOUGH CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED HER
89-218-0011.flac,AND FORCED HER IN SPITE OF HER ANXIOUS DESIRE TO PENETRATE THIS MYSTERY TO PROCEED IN HER DRESSING WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY HER PROGRESS WAS NOT QUICK FOR HER THOUGHTS AND HER EYES WERE STILL BENT ON THE OBJECT SO WELL CALCULATED TO INTEREST AND ALARM AND THOUGH SHE DARED NOT WASTE A MOMENT UPON A SECOND ATTEMPT
89-218-0012.flac,SHE COULD NOT REMAIN MANY PACES FROM THE CHEST AT LENGTH HOWEVER HAVING SLIPPED ONE ARM INTO HER GOWN HER TOILETTE SEEMED SO NEARLY FINISHED THAT THE IMPATIENCE OF HER CURIOSITY MIGHT SAFELY BE INDULGED
89-218-0013.flac,AND SO DESPERATE SHOULD BE THE EXERTION OF HER STRENGTH THAT UNLESS SECURED BY SUPERNATURAL MEANS THE LID IN ONE MOMENT SHOULD BE THROWN BACK WITH THIS SPIRIT SHE SPRANG FORWARD AND HER CONFIDENCE DID NOT DECEIVE HER HER RESOLUTE EFFORT THREW BACK THE LID AND GAVE TO HER ASTONISHED EYES
89-218-0014.flac,ENTERED THE ROOM AND TO THE RISING SHAME OF HAVING HARBOURED FOR SOME MINUTES AN ABSURD EXPECTATION WAS THEN ADDED THE SHAME OF BEING CAUGHT IN SO IDLE A SEARCH
89-218-0015.flac,SAID MISS TILNEY AS CATHERINE HASTILY CLOSED IT AND TURNED AWAY TO THE GLASS
89-218-0016.flac,CATHERINE HAD NO LEISURE FOR SPEECH BEING AT ONCE BLUSHING TYING HER GOWN AND FORMING WISE RESOLUTIONS WITH THE MOST VIOLENT DISPATCH MISS TILNEY GENTLY HINTED HER FEAR OF BEING LATE AND IN HALF A MINUTE THEY RAN DOWNSTAIRS TOGETHER IN AN ALARM NOT WHOLLY UNFOUNDED
89-218-0017.flac,FOR GENERAL TILNEY WAS PACING THE DRAWING ROOM HIS WATCH IN HIS HAND AND HAVING ON THE VERY INSTANT OF THEIR ENTERING PULLED THE BELL WITH VIOLENCE ORDERED DINNER TO BE ON TABLE DIRECTLY CATHERINE TREMBLED AT THE EMPHASIS WITH WHICH HE SPOKE
89-218-0018.flac,AND SAT PALE AND BREATHLESS IN A MOST HUMBLE MOOD CONCERNED FOR HIS CHILDREN AND DETESTING OLD CHESTS AND THE GENERAL RECOVERING HIS POLITENESS AS HE LOOKED AT HER SPENT THE REST OF HIS TIME IN SCOLDING HIS DAUGHTER FOR SO FOOLISHLY HURRYING HER FAIR FRIEND
89-218-0019.flac,WHO WAS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF BREATH FROM HASTE WHEN THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST OCCASION FOR HURRY IN THE WORLD
89-218-0020.flac,TILL THEY WERE HAPPILY SEATED AT THE DINNER TABLE WHEN THE GENERAL'S COMPLACENT SMILES AND A GOOD APPETITE OF HER OWN RESTORED HER TO PEACE THE DINING PARLOUR WAS A NOBLE ROOM
89-218-0021.flac,AND FITTED UP IN A STYLE OF LUXURY AND EXPENSE WHICH WAS ALMOST LOST ON THE UNPRACTISED EYE OF CATHERINE WHO SAW LITTLE MORE THAN ITS SPACIOUSNESS AND THE NUMBER OF THEIR ATTENDANTS OF THE FORMER SHE SPOKE ALOUD HER ADMIRATION AND THE GENERAL WITH A VERY GRACIOUS COUNTENANCE
89-218-0022.flac,ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN ILL SIZED ROOM AND FURTHER CONFESSED THAT THOUGH AS CARELESS ON SUCH SUBJECTS AS MOST PEOPLE HE DID LOOK UPON A TOLERABLY LARGE EATING ROOM AS ONE OF THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE HE SUPPOSED HOWEVER
89-218-0023.flac,THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN USED TO MUCH BETTER SIZED APARTMENTS AT MISTER ALLEN'S NO INDEED WAS CATHERINE'S HONEST ASSURANCE MISTER ALLEN'S DINING PARLOUR WAS NOT MORE THAN HALF AS LARGE AND SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO LARGE A ROOM AS THIS IN HER LIFE
89-218-0024.flac,THE GENERAL'S GOOD HUMOUR INCREASED WHY AS HE HAD SUCH ROOMS HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SIMPLE NOT TO MAKE USE OF THEM
89-218-0025.flac,MISTER ALLEN'S HOUSE HE WAS SURE MUST BE EXACTLY OF THE TRUE SIZE FOR RATIONAL HAPPINESS THE EVENING PASSED WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DISTURBANCE AND IN THE OCCASIONAL ABSENCE OF GENERAL TILNEY WITH MUCH POSITIVE CHEERFULNESS
89-218-0026.flac,IT WAS ONLY IN HIS PRESENCE THAT CATHERINE FELT THE SMALLEST FATIGUE FROM HER JOURNEY AND EVEN THEN EVEN IN MOMENTS OF LANGUOR OR RESTRAINT A SENSE OF GENERAL HAPPINESS PREPONDERATED AND SHE COULD THINK OF HER FRIENDS IN BATH WITHOUT ONE WISH OF BEING WITH THEM THE NIGHT WAS STORMY
89-218-0027.flac,THE WIND HAD BEEN RISING AT INTERVALS THE WHOLE AFTERNOON AND BY THE TIME THE PARTY BROKE UP IT BLEW AND RAINED VIOLENTLY CATHERINE AS SHE CROSSED THE HALL LISTENED TO THE TEMPEST WITH SENSATIONS OF AWE AND WHEN SHE HEARD IT RAGE ROUND A CORNER OF THE ANCIENT BUILDING AND CLOSE WITH SUDDEN FURY A DISTANT DOOR
89-218-0028.flac,YES THESE WERE CHARACTERISTIC SOUNDS THEY BROUGHT TO HER RECOLLECTION A COUNTLESS VARIETY OF DREADFUL SITUATIONS AND HORRID SCENES WHICH SUCH BUILDINGS HAD WITNESSED AND SUCH STORMS USHERED IN
89-218-0029.flac,AND MOST HEARTILY DID SHE REJOICE IN THE HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HER ENTRANCE WITHIN WALLS SO SOLEMN SHE HAD NOTHING TO DREAD FROM MIDNIGHT ASSASSINS OR DRUNKEN GALLANTS
89-218-0030.flac,HENRY HAD CERTAINLY BEEN ONLY IN JEST IN WHAT HE HAD TOLD HER THAT MORNING IN A HOUSE SO FURNISHED AND SO GUARDED SHE COULD HAVE NOTHING TO EXPLORE OR TO SUFFER AND MIGHT GO TO HER BEDROOM AS SECURELY AS IF IT HAD BEEN HER OWN CHAMBER AT FULLERTON
89-218-0031.flac,SHE WAS ENABLED ESPECIALLY ON PERCEIVING THAT MISS TILNEY SLEPT ONLY TWO DOORS FROM HER TO ENTER HER ROOM WITH A TOLERABLY STOUT HEART AND HER SPIRITS WERE IMMEDIATELY ASSISTED BY THE CHEERFUL BLAZE OF A WOOD FIRE
89-218-0032.flac,AS SO MANY POOR GIRLS HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO DO AND THEN TO HAVE A FAITHFUL OLD SERVANT FRIGHTENING ONE BY COMING IN WITH A FAGGOT HOW GLAD I AM THAT NORTHANGER IS WHAT IT IS IF IT HAD BEEN LIKE SOME OTHER PLACES I DO NOT KNOW THAT IN SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS
89-218-0033.flac,I COULD HAVE ANSWERED FOR MY COURAGE BUT NOW TO BE SURE THERE IS NOTHING TO ALARM ONE SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM THE WINDOW CURTAINS SEEMED IN MOTION
89-218-0034.flac,A GLANCE AT THE OLD CHEST AS SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THIS EXAMINATION WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS USE SHE SCORNED THE CAUSELESS FEARS OF AN IDLE FANCY AND BEGAN WITH A MOST HAPPY INDIFFERENCE TO PREPARE HERSELF FOR BED SHE SHOULD TAKE HER TIME SHE SHOULD NOT HURRY HERSELF
89-218-0035.flac,AS IF SHE WISHED FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIGHT AFTER SHE WERE IN BED THE FIRE THEREFORE DIED AWAY AND CATHERINE HAVING SPENT THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR IN HER ARRANGEMENTS WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF STEPPING INTO BED WHEN ON GIVING A PARTING GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM
89-218-0036.flac,SHE WAS STRUCK BY THE APPEARANCE OF A HIGH OLD FASHIONED BLACK CABINET WHICH THOUGH IN A SITUATION CONSPICUOUS ENOUGH HAD NEVER CAUGHT HER NOTICE BEFORE HENRY'S WORDS HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE EBONY CABINET WHICH WAS TO ESCAPE HER OBSERVATION AT FIRST
89-218-0037.flac,IMMEDIATELY RUSHED ACROSS HER AND THOUGH THERE COULD BE NOTHING REALLY IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING WHIMSICAL IT WAS CERTAINLY A VERY REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE SHE TOOK HER CANDLE AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE CABINET IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY EBONY AND GOLD
89-218-0038.flac,BUT IT WAS JAPAN BLACK AND YELLOW JAPAN OF THE HANDSOMEST KIND AND AS SHE HELD HER CANDLE THE YELLOW HAD VERY MUCH THE EFFECT OF GOLD THE KEY WAS IN THE DOOR AND SHE HAD A STRANGE FANCY TO LOOK INTO IT NOT HOWEVER WITH THE SMALLEST EXPECTATION OF FINDING ANYTHING
89-218-0039.flac,BUT IT WAS SO VERY ODD AFTER WHAT HENRY HAD SAID IN SHORT SHE COULD NOT SLEEP TILL SHE HAD EXAMINED IT SO PLACING THE CANDLE WITH GREAT CAUTION ON A CHAIR SHE SEIZED THE KEY WITH A VERY TREMULOUS HAND AND TRIED TO TURN IT BUT IT RESISTED HER UTMOST STRENGTH
89-218-0040.flac,ALARMED BUT NOT DISCOURAGED SHE TRIED IT ANOTHER WAY A BOLT FLEW AND SHE BELIEVED HERSELF SUCCESSFUL BUT HOW STRANGELY MYSTERIOUS THE DOOR WAS STILL IMMOVABLE SHE PAUSED A MOMENT IN BREATHLESS WONDER
89-218-0041.flac,THE WIND ROARED DOWN THE CHIMNEY THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE WINDOWS AND EVERYTHING SEEMED TO SPEAK THE AWFULNESS OF HER SITUATION
89-218-0042.flac,TO RETIRE TO BED HOWEVER UNSATISFIED ON SUCH A POINT WOULD BE VAIN SINCE SLEEP MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CABINET SO MYSTERIOUSLY CLOSED IN HER IMMEDIATE VICINITY AGAIN THEREFORE SHE APPLIED HERSELF TO THE KEY
89-218-0043.flac,AND AFTER MOVING IT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY FOR SOME INSTANTS WITH THE DETERMINED CELERITY OF HOPE'S LAST EFFORT THE DOOR SUDDENLY YIELDED TO HER HAND HER HEART LEAPED WITH EXULTATION AT SUCH A VICTORY
89-218-0044.flac,AND HAVING THROWN OPEN EACH FOLDING DOOR THE SECOND BEING SECURED ONLY BY BOLTS OF LESS WONDERFUL CONSTRUCTION THAN THE LOCK THOUGH IN THAT HER EYE COULD NOT DISCERN ANYTHING UNUSUAL A DOUBLE RANGE OF SMALL DRAWERS APPEARED IN VIEW WITH SOME LARGER DRAWERS ABOVE AND BELOW THEM AND IN THE CENTRE
89-218-0045.flac,A SMALL DOOR CLOSED ALSO WITH A LOCK AND KEY SECURED IN ALL PROBABILITY A CAVITY OF IMPORTANCE CATHERINE'S HEART BEAT QUICK BUT HER COURAGE DID NOT FAIL HER WITH A CHEEK FLUSHED BY HOPE AND AN EYE STRAINING WITH CURIOSITY
89-218-0046.flac,HER FINGERS GRASPED THE HANDLE OF A DRAWER AND DREW IT FORTH IT WAS ENTIRELY EMPTY WITH LESS ALARM AND GREATER EAGERNESS SHE SEIZED A SECOND A THIRD A FOURTH EACH WAS EQUALLY EMPTY NOT ONE WAS LEFT UNSEARCHED
89-218-0047.flac,AND IN NOT ONE WAS ANYTHING FOUND WELL READ IN THE ART OF CONCEALING A TREASURE THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE LININGS TO THE DRAWERS DID NOT ESCAPE HER AND SHE FELT ROUND EACH WITH ANXIOUS ACUTENESS IN VAIN THE PLACE IN THE MIDDLE ALONE REMAINED NOW UNEXPLORED AND THOUGH SHE HAD
89-218-0048.flac,HER QUICK EYES DIRECTLY FELL ON A ROLL OF PAPER PUSHED BACK INTO THE FURTHER PART OF THE CAVITY APPARENTLY FOR CONCEALMENT AND HER FEELINGS AT THAT MOMENT WERE INDESCRIBABLE HER HEART FLUTTERED HER KNEES TREMBLED AND HER CHEEKS GREW PALE
89-218-0049.flac,SHE SEIZED WITH AN UNSTEADY HAND THE PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPT
89-218-0050.flac,AND WHILE SHE ACKNOWLEDGED WITH AWFUL SENSATIONS THIS STRIKING EXEMPLIFICATION OF WHAT HENRY HAD FORETOLD RESOLVED INSTANTLY TO PERUSE EVERY LINE BEFORE SHE ATTEMPTED TO REST THE DIMNESS OF THE LIGHT HER CANDLE EMITTED MADE HER TURN TO IT WITH ALARM
89-218-0051.flac,A LAMP COULD NOT HAVE EXPIRED WITH MORE AWFUL EFFECT CATHERINE FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS MOTIONLESS WITH HORROR IT WAS DONE COMPLETELY NOT A REMNANT OF LIGHT IN THE WICK COULD GIVE HOPE TO THE REKINDLING BREATH DARKNESS IMPENETRABLE AND IMMOVABLE FILLED THE ROOM
89-218-0052.flac,A VIOLENT GUST OF WIND RISING WITH SUDDEN FURY ADDED FRESH HORROR TO THE MOMENT CATHERINE TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN THE PAUSE WHICH SUCCEEDED A SOUND LIKE RECEDING FOOTSTEPS AND THE CLOSING OF A DISTANT DOOR
89-218-0053.flac,STRUCK ON HER AFFRIGHTED EAR HUMAN NATURE COULD SUPPORT NO MORE A COLD SWEAT STOOD ON HER FOREHEAD THE MANUSCRIPT FELL FROM HER HAND AND GROPING HER WAY TO THE BED SHE JUMPED HASTILY IN AND SOUGHT SOME SUSPENSION OF AGONY BY CREEPING FAR UNDERNEATH THE CLOTHES
89-218-0054.flac,TO CLOSE HER EYES IN SLEEP THAT NIGHT SHE FELT MUST BE ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION WITH A CURIOSITY SO JUSTLY AWAKENED AND FEELINGS IN EVERY WAY SO AGITATED REPOSE MUST BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE THE STORM TOO ABROAD SO DREADFUL
89-218-0055.flac,SHE HAD NOT BEEN USED TO FEEL ALARM FROM WIND BUT NOW EVERY BLAST SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH AWFUL INTELLIGENCE THE MANUSCRIPT SO WONDERFULLY FOUND SO WONDERFULLY ACCOMPLISHING THE MORNING'S PREDICTION HOW WAS IT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR WHAT COULD IT CONTAIN
89-218-0056.flac,BY WHAT MEANS COULD IT HAVE BEEN SO LONG CONCEALED AND HOW SINGULARLY STRANGE THAT IT SHOULD FALL TO HER LOT TO DISCOVER IT TILL SHE HAD MADE HERSELF MISTRESS OF ITS CONTENTS HOWEVER SHE COULD HAVE NEITHER REPOSE NOR COMFORT AND WITH THE SUN'S FIRST RAYS SHE WAS DETERMINED TO PERUSE IT
89-218-0057.flac,AS IF BY THE ATTEMPT OF SOMEBODY TO ENTER HOLLOW MURMURS SEEMED TO CREEP ALONG THE GALLERY AND MORE THAN ONCE HER BLOOD WAS CHILLED BY THE SOUND OF DISTANT MOANS
89-219-0000.flac,INSTANTANEOUSLY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF EXISTENCE RETURNED HER RECOLLECTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT AND SPRINGING FROM THE BED IN THE VERY MOMENT OF THE MAID'S GOING AWAY SHE EAGERLY COLLECTED EVERY SCATTERED SHEET WHICH HAD BURST FROM THE ROLL ON ITS FALLING TO THE GROUND AND FLEW BACK TO ENJOY THE LUXURY OF THEIR PERUSAL ON HER PILLOW
89-219-0001.flac,SHE NOW PLAINLY SAW THAT SHE MUST NOT EXPECT A MANUSCRIPT OF EQUAL LENGTH WITH THE GENERALITY OF WHAT SHE HAD SHUDDERED OVER IN BOOKS FOR THE ROLL SEEMING TO CONSIST ENTIRELY OF SMALL DISJOINTED SHEETS WAS ALTOGETHER BUT OF TRIFLING SIZE
89-219-0002.flac,AND MUCH LESS THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED IT TO BE AT FIRST HER GREEDY EYE GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER A PAGE SHE STARTED AT ITS IMPORT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE OR DID NOT HER SENSES PLAY HER FALSE AN INVENTORY OF LINEN
89-219-0003.flac,IN COARSE AND MODERN CHARACTERS SEEMED ALL THAT WAS BEFORE HER IF THE EVIDENCE OF SIGHT MIGHT BE TRUSTED SHE HELD A WASHING BILL IN HER HAND SHE SEIZED ANOTHER SHEET AND SAW THE SAME ARTICLES WITH LITTLE VARIATION A THIRD A FOURTH AND A FIFTH PRESENTED NOTHING NEW
89-219-0004.flac,SHIRTS STOCKINGS CRAVATS AND WAISTCOATS FACED HER IN EACH TWO OTHERS PENNED BY THE SAME HAND MARKED AN EXPENDITURE SCARCELY MORE INTERESTING IN LETTERS HAIR POWDER SHOE STRING AND BREECHES BALL AND THE LARGER SHEET
89-219-0005.flac,TO SUPPOSE THAT A MANUSCRIPT OF MANY GENERATIONS BACK COULD HAVE REMAINED UNDISCOVERED IN A ROOM SUCH AS THAT SO MODERN SO HABITABLE
89-219-0006.flac,FOR HAD NOT THE CABINET APPEARED SO EXACTLY TO AGREE WITH HIS DESCRIPTION OF HER ADVENTURES SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FELT THE SMALLEST CURIOSITY ABOUT IT THIS WAS THE ONLY COMFORT THAT OCCURRED IMPATIENT TO GET RID OF THOSE HATEFUL EVIDENCES OF HER FOLLY THOSE DETESTABLE PAPERS THEN SCATTERED OVER THE BED
89-219-0007.flac,FOR SHE COULD NOW MANAGE THEM WITH PERFECT EASE IN THIS THERE WAS SURELY SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS AND SHE INDULGED IN THE FLATTERING SUGGESTION FOR HALF A MINUTE TILL THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DOOR'S HAVING BEEN AT FIRST UNLOCKED
89-219-0008.flac,AND YET UNEQUAL TO AN ABSOLUTE FALSEHOOD
89-219-0009.flac,BUT WE HAVE A CHARMING MORNING AFTER IT SHE ADDED DESIRING TO GET RID OF THE SUBJECT
89-219-0010.flac,AND HOW MIGHT YOU LEARN BY ACCIDENT OR ARGUMENT
89-219-0011.flac,AS A MEANS OF GETTING YOU OUT OF DOORS AND TEMPTING YOU TO MORE FREQUENT EXERCISE THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE TAKE AND THOUGH THE LOVE OF A HYACINTH MAY BE RATHER DOMESTIC WHO CAN TELL THE SENTIMENT ONCE RAISED BUT YOU MAY IN TIME COME TO LOVE A ROSE
89-219-0012.flac,BUT I DO NOT WANT ANY SUCH PURSUIT TO GET ME OUT OF DOORS THE PLEASURE OF WALKING AND BREATHING FRESH AIR IS ENOUGH FOR ME
89-219-0013.flac,MAMMA SAYS I AM NEVER WITHIN
89-219-0014.flac,THE MERE HABIT OF LEARNING TO LOVE IS THE THING AND A TEACHABLENESS OF DISPOSITION IN A YOUNG LADY IS A GREAT BLESSING HAS MY SISTER A PLEASANT MODE OF INSTRUCTION CATHERINE WAS SAVED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF ATTEMPTING AN ANSWER BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE GENERAL
89-219-0015.flac,WHOSE SMILING COMPLIMENTS ANNOUNCED A HAPPY STATE OF MIND BUT WHOSE GENTLE HINT OF SYMPATHETIC EARLY RISING DID NOT ADVANCE HER COMPOSURE THE ELEGANCE OF THE BREAKFAST SET FORCED ITSELF ON CATHERINE'S NOTICE WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TABLE AND LUCIDLY IT HAD BEEN THE GENERAL'S CHOICE
89-219-0016.flac,HE WAS ENCHANTED BY HER APPROBATION OF HIS TASTE CONFESSED IT TO BE NEAT AND SIMPLE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO ENCOURAGE THE MANUFACTURE OF HIS COUNTRY AND FOR HIS PART TO HIS UNCRITICAL PALATE THE TEA WAS AS WELL FLAVOURED FROM THE CLAY OF STAFFORDSHIRE
89-219-0017.flac,HE TRUSTED HOWEVER THAT AN OPPORTUNITY MIGHT ERE LONG OCCUR OF SELECTING ONE THOUGH NOT FOR HIMSELF CATHERINE WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM
89-219-0018.flac,SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST HENRY LEFT THEM FOR WOODSTON WHERE BUSINESS REQUIRED AND WOULD KEEP HIM TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY ALL ATTENDED IN THE HALL TO SEE HIM MOUNT HIS HORSE AND IMMEDIATELY ON RE ENTERING THE BREAKFAST ROOM CATHERINE WALKED TO A WINDOW IN THE HOPE OF CATCHING ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF HIS FIGURE
89-219-0019.flac,OBSERVED THE GENERAL TO ELEANOR WOODSTON WILL MAKE BUT A SOMBRE APPEARANCE TODAY IS IT A PRETTY PLACE ASKED CATHERINE WHAT SAY YOU ELEANOR SPEAK YOUR OPINION FOR LADIES CAN BEST TELL THE TASTE OF LADIES IN REGARD TO PLACES AS WELL AS MEN
89-219-0020.flac,I THINK IT WOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE MOST IMPARTIAL EYE TO HAVE MANY RECOMMENDATIONS THE HOUSE STANDS AMONG FINE MEADOWS FACING THE SOUTH EAST WITH AN EXCELLENT KITCHEN GARDEN IN THE SAME ASPECT
89-219-0021.flac,THE WALLS SURROUNDING WHICH I BUILT AND STOCKED MYSELF ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY SON IT IS A FAMILY LIVING MISS MORLAND AND THE PROPERTY IN THE PLACE BEING CHIEFLY MY OWN YOU MAY BELIEVE I TAKE CARE THAT IT SHALL NOT BE A BAD ONE
89-219-0022.flac,DID HENRY'S INCOME DEPEND SOLELY ON THIS LIVING HE WOULD NOT BE ILL PROVIDED FOR PERHAPS IT MAY SEEM ODD THAT WITH ONLY TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN I SHOULD THINK ANY PROFESSION NECESSARY FOR HIM AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN WE COULD ALL WISH HIM DISENGAGED FROM EVERY TIE OF BUSINESS
89-219-0023.flac,BUT THOUGH I MAY NOT EXACTLY MAKE CONVERTS OF YOU YOUNG LADIES I AM SURE YOUR FATHER MISS MORLAND WOULD AGREE WITH ME IN THINKING IT EXPEDIENT TO GIVE EVERY YOUNG MAN SOME EMPLOYMENT THE MONEY IS NOTHING IT IS NOT AN OBJECT BUT EMPLOYMENT IS THE THING
89-219-0024.flac,HAS HIS PROFESSION THE IMPOSING EFFECT OF THIS LAST ARGUMENT WAS EQUAL TO HIS WISHES THE SILENCE OF THE LADY PROVED IT TO BE UNANSWERABLE SOMETHING HAD BEEN SAID THE EVENING BEFORE OF HER BEING SHOWN OVER THE HOUSE AND HE NOW OFFERED HIMSELF AS HER CONDUCTOR
89-219-0025.flac,AND THOUGH CATHERINE HAD HOPED TO EXPLORE IT ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY HIS DAUGHTER IT WAS A PROPOSAL OF TOO MUCH HAPPINESS IN ITSELF UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE GLADLY ACCEPTED
89-219-0026.flac,AND HAD SEEN ONLY A FEW OF ITS ROOMS THE NETTING BOX JUST LEISURELY DRAWN FORTH WAS CLOSED WITH JOYFUL HASTE AND SHE WAS READY TO ATTEND HIM IN A MOMENT
89-219-0027.flac,THE PLEASURE OF ACCOMPANYING HER INTO THE SHRUBBERIES AND GARDEN SHE CURTSIED HER ACQUIESCENCE BUT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MORE AGREEABLE TO HER TO MAKE THOSE HER FIRST OBJECT
89-219-0028.flac,THE WEATHER WAS AT PRESENT FAVOURABLE AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE UNCERTAINTY WAS VERY GREAT OF ITS CONTINUING SO WHICH WOULD SHE PREFER HE WAS EQUALLY AT HER SERVICE
89-219-0029.flac,HE YIELDED IMPLICITLY AND WOULD FETCH HIS HAT AND ATTEND THEM IN A MOMENT HE LEFT THE ROOM AND CATHERINE WITH A DISAPPOINTED ANXIOUS FACE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HER UNWILLINGNESS THAT HE SHOULD BE TAKING THEM OUT OF DOORS AGAINST HIS OWN INCLINATION UNDER A MISTAKEN IDEA OF PLEASING HER
89-219-0030.flac,CATHERINE DID NOT EXACTLY KNOW HOW THIS WAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD WHY WAS MISS TILNEY EMBARRASSED COULD THERE BE ANY UNWILLINGNESS ON THE GENERAL'S SIDE TO SHOW HER OVER THE ABBEY THE PROPOSAL WAS HIS OWN
89-219-0031.flac,NEITHER HER FATHER NOR MISTER ALLEN DID SO IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY PROVOKING
89-219-0032.flac,IF HENRY HAD BEEN WITH THEM INDEED BUT NOW SHE SHOULD NOT KNOW WHAT WAS PICTURESQUE WHEN SHE SAW IT SUCH WERE HER THOUGHTS BUT SHE KEPT THEM TO HERSELF AND PUT ON HER BONNET IN PATIENT DISCONTENT SHE WAS STRUCK HOWEVER BEYOND HER EXPECTATION BY THE GRANDEUR OF THE ABBEY
89-219-0033.flac,AS SHE SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THE LAWN THE WHOLE BUILDING ENCLOSED A LARGE COURT AND TWO SIDES OF THE QUADRANGLE RICH IN GOTHIC ORNAMENTS STOOD FORWARD FOR ADMIRATION THE REMAINDER WAS SHUT OFF BY KNOLLS OF OLD TREES OR LUXURIANT PLANTATIONS
89-219-0034.flac,AND THE STEEP WOODY HILLS RISING BEHIND TO GIVE IT SHELTER WERE BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN THE LEAFLESS MONTH OF MARCH CATHERINE HAD SEEN NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH IT AND HER FEELINGS OF DELIGHT WERE SO STRONG THAT WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY BETTER AUTHORITY SHE BOLDLY BURST FORTH IN WONDER AND PRAISE
89-219-0035.flac,THE GENERAL LISTENED WITH ASSENTING GRATITUDE AND IT SEEMED AS IF HIS OWN ESTIMATION OF NORTHANGER HAD WAITED UNFIXED TILL THAT HOUR
89-219-0036.flac,AND HE LED THE WAY TO IT ACROSS A SMALL PORTION OF THE PARK THE NUMBER OF ACRES CONTAINED IN THIS GARDEN WAS SUCH AS CATHERINE COULD NOT LISTEN TO WITHOUT DISMAY BEING MORE THAN DOUBLE THE EXTENT OF ALL MISTER ALLEN'S AS WELL AS HER FATHER'S INCLUDING CHURCH YARD AND ORCHARD
89-219-0037.flac,THE WALLS SEEMED COUNTLESS IN NUMBER ENDLESS IN LENGTH A VILLAGE OF HOT HOUSES SEEMED TO ARISE AMONG THEM AND A WHOLE PARISH TO BE AT WORK WITHIN THE ENCLOSURE THE GENERAL WAS FLATTERED BY HER LOOKS OF SURPRISE WHICH TOLD HIM ALMOST AS PLAINLY
89-219-0038.flac,AS HE SOON FORCED HER TO TELL HIM IN WORDS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY GARDENS AT ALL EQUAL TO THEM BEFORE
89-219-0039.flac,WITHOUT ANY AMBITION OF THAT SORT HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT HE DID BELIEVE THEM TO BE UNRIVALLED IN THE KINGDOM IF HE HAD A HOBBY HORSE IT WAS THAT HE LOVED A GARDEN THOUGH CARELESS ENOUGH IN MOST MATTERS OF EATING HE LOVED GOOD FRUIT
89-219-0040.flac,OR IF HE DID NOT HIS FRIENDS AND CHILDREN DID THERE WERE GREAT VEXATIONS HOWEVER ATTENDING SUCH A GARDEN AS HIS
89-219-0041.flac,WITH A TRIUMPHANT SMILE OF SELF SATISFACTION THE GENERAL WISHED HE COULD DO THE SAME
89-219-0042.flac,BY ITS FALLING SHORT OF HIS PLAN HOW WERE MISTER ALLEN'S SUCCESSION HOUSES WORKED DESCRIBING THE NATURE OF HIS OWN AS THEY ENTERED THEM MISTER ALLEN HAD ONLY ONE SMALL HOT HOUSE WHICH MISSUS ALLEN HAD THE USE OF FOR HER PLANTS IN WINTER AND THERE WAS A FIRE IN IT NOW AND THEN
89-219-0043.flac,HE IS A HAPPY MAN SAID THE GENERAL WITH A LOOK OF VERY HAPPY CONTEMPT HAVING TAKEN HER INTO EVERY DIVISION AND LED HER UNDER EVERY WALL TILL SHE WAS HEARTILY WEARY OF SEEING AND WONDERING
89-219-0044.flac,HE SUFFERED THE GIRLS AT LAST TO SEIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF AN OUTER DOOR AND THEN EXPRESSING HIS WISH TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SOME RECENT ALTERATIONS ABOUT THE TEA HOUSE PROPOSED IT AS NO UNPLEASANT EXTENSION OF THEIR WALK IF MISS MORLAND WERE NOT TIRED
89-219-0045.flac,BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING ELEANOR WHY DO YOU CHOOSE THAT COLD DAMP PATH TO IT MISS MORLAND WILL GET WET OUR BEST WAY IS ACROSS THE PARK
89-219-0046.flac,SAID MISS TILNEY THAT I ALWAYS THINK IT THE BEST AND NEAREST WAY
89-219-0047.flac,IT WAS A NARROW WINDING PATH THROUGH A THICK GROVE OF OLD SCOTCH FIRS AND CATHERINE STRUCK BY ITS GLOOMY ASPECT AND EAGER TO ENTER IT COULD NOT EVEN BY THE GENERAL'S DISAPPROBATION BE KEPT FROM STEPPING FORWARD
89-219-0048.flac,HE PERCEIVED HER INCLINATION AND HAVING AGAIN URGED THE PLEA OF HEALTH IN VAIN WAS TOO POLITE TO MAKE FURTHER OPPOSITION HE EXCUSED HIMSELF HOWEVER FROM ATTENDING THEM THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE NOT TOO CHEERFUL FOR HIM AND HE WOULD MEET THEM BY ANOTHER COURSE HE TURNED AWAY
89-219-0049.flac,AND CATHERINE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND HOW MUCH HER SPIRITS WERE RELIEVED BY THE SEPARATION
89-219-0050.flac,OFFERED IT NO INJURY AND SHE BEGAN TO TALK WITH EASY GAIETY OF THE DELIGHTFUL MELANCHOLY WHICH SUCH A GROVE INSPIRED I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF THIS SPOT SAID HER COMPANION WITH A SIGH IT WAS MY MOTHER'S FAVOURITE WALK
89-219-0051.flac,CATHERINE HAD NEVER HEARD MISSUS TILNEY MENTIONED IN THE FAMILY BEFORE AND THE INTEREST EXCITED BY THIS TENDER REMEMBRANCE SHOWED ITSELF DIRECTLY IN HER ALTERED COUNTENANCE AND IN THE ATTENTIVE PAUSE WITH WHICH SHE WAITED FOR SOMETHING MORE
89-219-0052.flac,ADDED ELEANOR THOUGH I NEVER LOVED IT THEN AS I HAVE LOVED IT SINCE AT THAT TIME INDEED I USED TO WONDER AT HER CHOICE BUT HER MEMORY ENDEARS IT NOW AND OUGHT IT NOT REFLECTED CATHERINE TO ENDEAR IT TO HER HUSBAND YET THE GENERAL WOULD NOT ENTER IT
89-219-0053.flac,MISS TILNEY CONTINUING SILENT SHE VENTURED TO SAY HER DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT AFFLICTION A GREAT AND INCREASING ONE REPLIED THE OTHER IN A LOW VOICE
89-219-0054.flac,I WAS ONLY THIRTEEN WHEN IT HAPPENED AND THOUGH I FELT MY LOSS PERHAPS AS STRONGLY AS ONE SO YOUNG COULD FEEL IT I DID NOT I COULD NOT THEN KNOW WHAT A LOSS IT WAS SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED WITH GREAT FIRMNESS
89-219-0055.flac,A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN ALWAYS PRESENT A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN A CONSTANT FRIEND
89-219-0056.flac,WAS SHE A VERY CHARMING WOMAN WAS SHE HANDSOME WAS THERE ANY PICTURE OF HER IN THE ABBEY
89-219-0057.flac,WAS IT FROM DEJECTION OF SPIRITS WERE QUESTIONS NOW EAGERLY POURED FORTH THE FIRST THREE RECEIVED A READY AFFIRMATIVE
89-219-0058.flac,HER PICTURE I SUPPOSE BLUSHING AT THE CONSUMMATE ART OF HER OWN QUESTION HANGS IN YOUR FATHER'S ROOM NO IT WAS INTENDED FOR THE DRAWING ROOM BUT MY FATHER WAS DISSATISFIED WITH THE PAINTING AND FOR SOME TIME IT HAD NO PLACE
89-219-0059.flac,SOON AFTER HER DEATH I OBTAINED IT FOR MY OWN AND HUNG IT IN MY BED CHAMBER
89-219-0060.flac,IT IS VERY LIKE HERE WAS ANOTHER PROOF A PORTRAIT VERY LIKE OF A DEPARTED WIFE NOT VALUED BY THE HUSBAND HE MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFULLY CRUEL TO HER
89-219-0061.flac,IN SPITE OF ALL HIS ATTENTIONS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY EXCITED AND WHAT HAD BEEN TERROR AND DISLIKE BEFORE WAS NOW ABSOLUTE AVERSION YES AVERSION HIS CRUELTY TO SUCH A CHARMING WOMAN MADE HIM ODIOUS TO HER
89-219-0062.flac,SHE HAD OFTEN READ OF SUCH CHARACTERS CHARACTERS WHICH MISTER ALLEN HAD BEEN USED TO CALL UNNATURAL AND OVERDRAWN BUT HERE WAS PROOF POSITIVE OF THE CONTRARY SHE HAD JUST SETTLED THIS POINT WHEN THE END OF THE PATH BROUGHT THEM DIRECTLY UPON THE GENERAL
89-219-0063.flac,AND IN SPITE OF ALL HER VIRTUOUS INDIGNATION SHE FOUND HERSELF AGAIN OBLIGED TO WALK WITH HIM LISTEN TO HIM AND EVEN TO SMILE WHEN HE SMILED BEING NO LONGER ABLE HOWEVER TO RECEIVE PLEASURE FROM THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS SHE SOON BEGAN TO WALK WITH LASSITUDE
89-219-0064.flac,THE GENERAL PERCEIVED IT AND WITH A CONCERN FOR HER HEALTH WHICH SEEMED TO REPROACH HER FOR HER OPINION OF HIM WAS MOST URGENT FOR RETURNING WITH HIS DAUGHTER TO THE HOUSE HE WOULD FOLLOW THEM IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
6000-86686-0000.flac,WELL WELL BUT THE DARKNESS OF MANKIND IS UNTOLLABLE WELL SIR YOU MUST KNOW AS YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT AFORE THAT THERE WAS A KING

6000-55211-0060.flac,THE GIRL WAS THE MOST STUBBORN UNREASONABLE VIXENISH LITTLE PUSS I EVER SAW I DIDN'T WANT HER OLD LOWESTOFT IF SHE DIDN'T WANT TO SELL IT BUT TO PRACTICALLY INVITE ME THERE AND THEN TREAT ME LIKE THAT SCOLDED THE COLLECTOR HIS FACE GROWING RED WITH ANGER
6000-55211-0061.flac,STILL I WAS SORRY FOR THE POOR LITTLE OLD LADY I WISH SOMEHOW SHE COULD HAVE THAT HUNDRED DOLLARS IT WAS THE MAN WHO SAID THIS NOT THE COLLECTOR SO DO I REJOINED BILLY DOLEFULLY
5390-24512-0000.flac,FOR ALTHOUGH THE JEWISH FAMILY OF THE HERODS REIGNED OVER JUDEA THEY ONLY HELD THEIR THRONE UNDER THE ROMAN EMPEROR THIS THE JEWS COULD NOT ENDURE THEY LONGED TO BE A FREE AND INDEPENDENT NATION ONCE AGAIN
5390-24512-0001.flac,WHEN OUR MESSIAH COMES HE WILL BE A GREAT WARRIOR THEY SAID HE WILL UTTERLY DESTROY ALL OUR ENEMIES HE WILL MAKE JERUSALEM THE GREATEST AND RICHEST CITY
5390-24512-0002.flac,HAD JESUS OF NAZARETH BEEN WILLING TO BECOME THEIR EARTHLY KING AND TO LEAD THE NATION AGAINST THE ROMANS THE JEWS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FOLLOWED HIM TO A MAN
5390-24512-0003.flac,THE SAVIOUR SOUGHT TO HEAL IT HE CALLED OUT THE FAITH AND GRATITUDE OF THE ROMAN CENTURION AND HIS ANSWER TO THE JEWISH LEADERS RENDER TO CAESAR THE THINGS THAT ARE CAESAR'S
5390-24512-0004.flac,SHOWED THEM THE RIGHT ATTITUDE IN WHICH TO REGARD THE ROMAN RULE
5390-24512-0005.flac,THE ROMAN GOVERNMENT HAD NO QUARREL WITH HIM THINE OWN NATION HATH DELIVERED THEE UNTO ME
5390-24512-0006.flac,HAD NOT THE JEWS PREVENTED IT IF THOU LET THIS MAN GO THOU ART NOT CAESAR'S FRIEND THEY CRIED
5390-24512-0007.flac,TO CRUCIFY JESUS OF NAZARETH AND TO FREE BARABBAS BUT IN CHOOSING THE REBEL BARABBAS
5390-24512-0008.flac,AS THEIR HERO THE NATION STARTED ON THEIR DOWNWARD ROAD AS THE STORY OF THE FORTY YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED THE SAVIOUR'S CRUCIFIXION CLEARLY SHOWS FOR THE JEWS WERE DETERMINED AT ALL COSTS TO THROW OFF THE ROMAN YOKE
5390-24512-0009.flac,AND THE HISTORY OF THOSE YEARS IS ONE LONG LIST OF TERRIBLE RISINGS AND MASSACRES WHILE CITIES WERE RUINED VILLAGES WRAPPED IN FLAMES AND MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN PERISHED WITH HUNGER
5390-24512-0010.flac,YET THE KEENER THE SUFFERING THE MORE DESPERATE THE JEWS BECAME THEIR WHOLE SOULS WERE POSSESSED WITH A WILD AND MAD PASSION FOR REVENGE
5390-24512-0011.flac,THEN IF ANY MAN SHALL SAY UNTO YOU LO HERE IS CHRIST OR THERE BELIEVE IT NOT MATTHEW
5390-24512-0012.flac,YET NO SOONER DID A DARING REBEL OR MURDERER GATHER A BAND OF ROBBERS AROUND HIM AND BEGIN TO KILL AND PLUNDER THAN MULTITUDES OF JEWS CRIED THE CHRIST OR MESSIAH HAS COME
5390-24512-0013.flac,WHERE THE ROMAN SOLDIERS WERE QUARTERED AND CRIED OUT TO THE GARRISON WITHIN THAT THEIR LIVES SHOULD BE SPARED IF THEY WOULD LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS THE ROMAN SOLDIERS HESITATED BUT THE JEWS PROMISED MOST FAITHFULLY TO KEEP THEIR WORD
5390-24512-0014.flac,THE ROMANS BELIEVED THEM AND OPENED THEIR GATES BUT NO SOONER WERE THEY IN THE POWER OF THE JEWISH MOB THAN THEY WERE FALLEN UPON AND MURDERED TO THE LAST MAN AS THEY DIED THE ROMAN SOLDIERS WHOM NOT EVEN DEATH COULD TERRIFY
5390-24512-0015.flac,LIFTED UP THEIR HANDS TO HEAVEN AS THOUGH CALLING UPON GOD TO WITNESS THAT THE JEWS HAD BROKEN THEIR SOLEMN OATH THE ROMAN EMPEROR COULD NOT OVERLOOK SUCH REBELLION AND TREACHERY
5390-24512-0016.flac,AND HE SENT A GREAT ARMY AGAINST JERUSALEM THE JEWS SHUT THE GATES OF THEIR CITY AND SO BEGAN THE AWFUL SIEGE OF JERUSALEM AND WHEN YE SHALL SEE JERUSALEM COMPASSED WITH ARMIES
5390-24512-0017.flac,HE WAS A PRISONER IN THE ROMAN CAMP DURING THE SIEGE OF JERUSALEM AND HE WATCHED WITH DISMAY THE GREAT BATTERING RAMS AND WAR ENGINES CRASHING THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE HOLY CITY HIS EARS RANG WITH THE CRIES OF RAGE AND DESPAIR WHICH BROKE FROM THE JEWS WITHIN
5390-24512-0018.flac,AS ONE BY ONE THEIR DEFENCES FELL AND THE END DREW NEAR THEN FOOD FAILED IN THE CITY MEN FOUGHT LIKE DEMONS IN THE STREETS FOR A TINY LOAF OF BARLEY BREAD SO FRANTIC WERE THE PEOPLE WITH HUNGER
5390-24512-0019.flac,THAT MOTHERS EVEN SNATCHED THE BREAD FROM THEIR OWN CHILDREN'S MOUTHS LOOK OVER THE WALLS O PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM THE ROMAN SOLDIERS ARE CRUCIFYING ALL THE PRISONERS THEY HAVE TAKEN AND THE LINE OF CROSSES IS AS LONG AS OUR CITY IS WIDE
5390-24512-0020.flac,HARD MERCILESS AS WAS THE ROMAN GENERAL EVEN HE GREW SICK WITH HORROR AT LAST AND HE SENT HIS JEWISH PRISONER JOSEPHUS TO THE JEWS PROMISING THEM THEIR LIVES IF THEY WOULD GIVE UP THE CITY
5390-24512-0021.flac,BUT A FURIOUS MADNESS HAD POSSESSED THE PEOPLE AND THEY REFUSED TO YIELD JOSEPHUS PLEADED IN VAIN HE WAS NOT A CHRISTIAN BUT HE COULD SEE PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT GOD WAS NO LONGER WITH HIS PEOPLE
5390-24512-0022.flac,AH MY COUNTRYMEN HE CRIED WE DID NOTHING WITHOUT GOD IN THE PAST BUT NOW YOU ARE FIGHTING AGAINST HIM HAD GOD JUDGED YOU WORTHY OF FREEDOM HE WOULD HAVE PUNISHED THE ROMANS AS HE DID THE ASSYRIANS LONG AGO
5390-24512-0023.flac,EVEN A JEW WHO HAD NO FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST COULD SEE PLAINLY THAT THE ANCIENT POWER AND GLORY OF HIS NATION HAD GONE AT LAST THE END CAME THE FIRST WALL FELL
5390-24512-0024.flac,WHICH STILL GLITTERED LIKE A HILL OF SNOW IN THE MORNING SUNSHINE OR SPARKLED AS THOUGH WRAPPED IN FLAME WHEN THE SUNBEAMS STRUCK FULL ON ITS GOLDEN ROOF THEN REDDER FLAMES THAN EVER THE SUNSHINE MADE LEAPT ABOVE THE GOLDEN ROOF
5390-24512-0025.flac,PILLARS FELL BEAMS CRUMBLED TO ASHES WHILE ROUND THE ALTAR OF SACRIFICE THE PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM LAY HEAPED TOGETHER SLAIN IN SUCH NUMBERS IN THE HOLY PLACE THAT THEIR BLOOD FLOWED DOWN THE BROAD MARBLE STEPS IN A HEAVY CRIMSON STREAM
5390-24512-0026.flac,AND THE GOLDEN CANDLESTICK AND THE BOOK OF THE LAW WERE CARRIED AWAY IN TRIUMPH INTO HEATHEN ROME ALAS FOR THE HOLY CITY OVER WHICH THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD HAD STOOD AND WEPT FORTY YEARS BEFORE
5390-24512-0027.flac,KNOWING THE SUFFERING THAT LAY BEFORE HER THESE JEWS ARE DANGEROUS WE MUST NOT ALLOW THEM TO REBUILD THEIR CITY OR TO BECOME A SEPARATE PEOPLE AGAIN AS A NATION THEY MUST CEASE TO EXIST
5390-24512-0028.flac,SO THE ROMAN CONQUERORS OF JERUSALEM AGREED AND FROM THAT DAY ONWARD THE JEWISH PEOPLE HAVE HAD NO COUNTRY OF THEIR OWN THEY HAVE INDEED BEEN LED AWAY CAPTIVE INTO ALL NATIONS
5390-24512-0029.flac,EXACTLY AS THE LORD FORETOLD THERE IS SCARCELY A COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE JEWS MAY NOT BE FOUND BUT JERUSALEM LIES STILL IN THE HANDS OF STRANGERS AND IS THE PROPERTY OF THE TURKISH NATION
5390-24512-0030.flac,THE JEWS WERE NOW NO LONGER A NATION THEY HAD BECOME MERELY A BODY OF PEOPLE LED BY THEIR RABBIS OR TEACHERS OF THE LAW BUT THEY WERE STILL THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK
5390-24512-0031.flac,THEY ALLOWED THE JEWISH TEACHERS TO CONTINUE THE SYNAGOGUE SERVICES IN OTHER PARTS OF PALESTINE AND TO TEACH IN THEIR COLLEGES THE MOST FAMOUS JEWISH COLLEGE OF THESE DAYS WAS AT TIBERIUS ON THE SHORES OF THE SEA OF GALILEE
5390-24512-0032.flac,OVER WHOSE CLEAR DEPTHS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST HAD SAILED SO OFTEN AND BESIDE WHOSE SHORES HE HAD DONE SO MANY WONDERFUL DEEDS OF LOVE AND MERCY A GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL COLLEGE IT WAS WITH BROAD TERRACED GARDENS
5390-24512-0033.flac,SO ALL DAY LONG THEY STUDIED AND COPIED THE OLD HEBREW BIBLE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE JEWISH SCRIBES HAD NOT BEEN CONTENT WITH TAKING THE WORD OF GOD JUST AS IT STOOD THEY HAD BEGUN EVEN IN OUR LORD'S DAY
5390-24512-0034.flac,THAT THEY DECLARED A MAN TO BE A BLOCKHEAD IF HE KNEW ONLY THE SCRIPTURES AND NOT THE TALMUD EXPLANATION THE LAW OF MOSES IS LIKE SALT BUT THE TALMUD IS BALMY SPICE THEY WOULD SAY
5390-24512-0035.flac,YET ALTHOUGH THEY HEEDED SO LITTLE THE TRUE MEANING OF GOD'S BOOK THEY GUARDED ITS WORDS MORE AND MORE CAREFULLY AND THE RULES FOR COPYING ANY PORTION OF THE HOLY BOOKS WERE STRICT INDEED MY SON AN OLD TEACHER WOULD SAY TO HIS PUPIL
5390-24512-0036.flac,BEFORE YOU COPY A SINGLE WORD YOU MUST WASH YOUR BODY ALL OVER AND CLOTHE YOURSELF IN FULL JEWISH DRESS PREPARING YOUR MIND WITH SOLEMN THOUGHTS THE PARCHMENT YOU WRITE UPON MUST BE MADE FROM THE SKINS OF CLEAN ANIMALS ONLY
5390-24512-0037.flac,THAT IS CLEAN ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF MOSES THE INK YOU WRITE WITH MUST BE OF A PURE BLACK MADE ONLY FROM A MIXTURE OF SOOT CHARCOAL AND HONEY
5390-24512-0038.flac,THOUGH YOU KNOW THE WHOLE BOOK OF THE LAW BY HEART YOU MUST NOT WRITE A SINGLE WORD FROM MEMORY BUT RAISE YOUR EYES TO YOUR COPY AND PRONOUNCE THE WORD ALOUD BEFORE TRUSTING IT TO YOUR PEN
5390-24512-0039.flac,BEFORE WRITING ANY OF THE NAMES OF GOD YOU MUST WASH YOUR PEN BEFORE WRITING HIS MOST SACRED NAME YOU MUST WASH YOUR WHOLE BODY IF AFTER YOUR COPY HAS ITSELF BEEN EXAMINED THREE CORRECTIONS HAVE TO BE MADE
5390-24512-0040.flac,THAT COPY MUST BE DESTROYED NOT SATISFIED WITH ALL THESE DIRECTIONS THE MASTER TAUGHT HIS SCHOLAR TO COUNT THE LETTERS OF EVERY BOOK
5390-24512-0041.flac,IS THE MIDDLE LETTER OF ALL THE FIVE BOOKS OF MOSES
5390-24512-0042.flac,IS THE MIDDLE OF ALL THE WORDS
5390-24512-0043.flac,IS THE VERY CENTRE OF ALL THE VERSES THE LETTER A THAT IS THE HEBREW LETTER WHICH STANDS FOR A OCCURS FORTY TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN TIMES THE LETTER B THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN
5390-24512-0044.flac,AND SO ON NOT ONLY THIS BUT EVERY SCRIBE WAS REQUIRED TO KNOW FROM MEMORY EXACTLY HOW MANY LETTERS OF EACH KIND THERE SHOULD BE IN HIS SHEET BEFORE HE BEGAN TO WRITE EVERY SHEET OF PARCHMENT MUST CONTAIN AN EQUAL NUMBER OF LINES
5390-24512-0045.flac,AND THE BREADTH OF EACH COLUMN HAD TO BE THIRTY LETTERS WIDE THERE ARE ELEVEN VERSES IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW BEGINNING AND ENDING WITH N THERE ARE FORTY VERSES IN WHICH LO IS READ THREE TIMES AND SO ON AND SO ON
5390-24512-0046.flac,HOW TEDIOUS AND MEANINGLESS SUCH INFORMATION APPEARS OF WHAT VALUE WERE ALL THESE DETAILS TO SPEND ALL HIS DAYS IN LEARNING SUCH THINGS AS THESE COULD HAVE NO INFLUENCE ON A MAN'S CHARACTER NOR MAKE HIM A POWER FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD
5390-24512-0047.flac,NOT FOR THIS PURPOSE HAD GOD REVEALED HIS WILL TO MAN SOME YEARS AGO IN THE COFFIN OF AN EGYPTIAN MUMMY A LITTLE JAR OF WHEAT WAS FOUND FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS IT HAD LAIN THERE SHUT UP IN THE DARK
5390-24512-0048.flac,WHILE OUT IN THE FIELDS THE CORN WHICH HAD BEEN SOWN HAD GROWN UP AND BEEN REAPED EVERY YEAR AND MEN AND WOMEN HAD BEEN FED BUT THIS JAR OF CORN WAS USELESS BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN PREVENTED FROM DOING THE WORK IN THE WORLD FOR WHICH IT WAS CREATED
5390-24512-0049.flac,JUST SO WAS IT WITH THE HEBREW COPIES OF GOD'S WORD LOCKED UP IN A DEAD LANGUAGE KEPT CLOSE AWAY FROM THE WORLD THEY WERE LIKE THE JAR OF WHEAT WHICH COULD NOT GROW

5390-30096-0002.flac,DO YOU DO THAT EXCLAIMED MISS PATRICIA DOYLE WHO SAT BETWEEN HER UNCLE AND FATHER AND KEPT AN ACTIVE EYE UPON BOTH SO THE MAJOR SAYS ANSWERED UNCLE JOHN DRYLY AND IT'S TRUE
5390-30096-0003.flac,ASSERTED THE OTHER HE'S ASSISTED THREE OR FOUR SCORE YOUNG MEN TO START IN BUSINESS IN THE LAST YEAR TO MY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE BY LENDING THEM SUMS RANGING FROM ONE TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS
5390-30096-0004.flac,AND IT'S THE MOST WASTEFUL AND EXTRAVAGANT CHARITY I EVER HEARD OF BUT I'M SO GLAD CRIED PATSY CLAPPING HER HANDS WITH A DELIGHTED GESTURE IT'S A SPLENDID WAY TO DO GOOD
5390-30096-0005.flac,WITHOUT CAPITAL YOU KNOW MANY A YOUNG FELLOW WOULD NEVER GET HIS FOOT ON THE FIRST ROUND OF THE LADDER AND MANY WILL NEVER GET IT THERE IN ANY EVENT DECLARED THE MAJOR WITH A SHAKE OF HIS GRIZZLED HEAD
5390-30096-0006.flac,AND HOW CAN I TELL WHETHER THEY'RE DESARVING OR NOT RETORTED MAJOR DOYLE FIERCELY DO YE WANT ME TO BECOME A SLEUTH OR ENGAGE DETECTIVES TO TRACK THE OBJECTS OF YOUR ERRONEOUS PHILANTHROPY
5390-30096-0007.flac,I JUST HAVE TO FORM A JUDGMENT AN TAKE ME CHANCES AND WHIN A POOR DEVIL GOES WRONG
5390-30096-0008.flac,BUT SOME OF THEM MUST SUCCEED VENTURED PATSY IN A CONCILIATORY TONE SOME DO SAID JOHN MERRICK AND THAT REPAYS ME FOR ALL MY TROUBLE
5390-30096-0009.flac,QUERIED THE MAJOR YOU MANE ALL MY THROUBLE WELL AND YOUR MONEY
5390-30096-0010.flac,WITH ONE THING AND ANOTHER WHAT OF IT RETORTED THE LITTLE ROUND FACED MILLIONAIRE LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND STARING FIXEDLY AT THE OTHER THAT'S WHAT I EMPLOY YOU FOR NOW NOW GENTLEMEN CRIED PATSY EARNESTLY
5390-30096-0011.flac,OF HIS FALLING DOWN AND WORSHIPING HIM JOHN MERRICK WAS A MULTI MILLIONAIRE TO BE SURE BUT THERE WERE PALLIATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALMOST EXCUSED HIM HE HAD BEEN SO BUSILY OCCUPIED IN INDUSTRY
5390-30096-0012.flac,THAT HE NEVER NOTICED HOW HIS WEALTH WAS PILING UP UNTIL HE DISCOVERED IT BY ACCIDENT THEN HE PROMPTLY RETIRED TO GIVE THE OTHER FELLOWS A CHANCE AND HE NOW DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO SIMPLE ACTS OF CHARITY
5390-30096-0013.flac,AND THE WELFARE AND ENTERTAINMENT OF HIS THREE NIECES HE HAD RESCUED MAJOR DOYLE AND HIS DAUGHTER FROM A LOWLY CONDITION AND PLACED THE FORMER IN THE GREAT BANKING HOUSE OF ISHAM MARVIN AND COMPANY
5390-30096-0014.flac,SIMPLE IN HIS TASTES MODEST AND RETIRING LACKING THE EDUCATION AND REFINEMENTS OF POLITE SOCIETY BUT SHREWD AND EXPERIENCED IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD THE LITTLE MAN FOUND HIS GREATEST ENJOYMENT IN THE FAMILY CIRCLE
5390-30096-0015.flac,THAT HE HAD BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN FOUNDING BEING NO LONGER ABSORBED IN BUSINESS HE HAD COME TO DETEST ITS EVERY DETAIL AND SO ALLOWED HIS BANKERS TO CARE FOR HIS FORTUNE AND HIS BROTHER IN LAW TO DISBURSE HIS INCOME
5390-30096-0016.flac,WHILE HE HIMSELF STROVE TO ENJOY LIFE IN A SHY AND BOYISH FASHION THAT WAS AS UNUSUAL IN A MAN OF HIS WEALTH AS IT WAS ADMIRABLE HE HAD NEVER MARRIED
5390-30096-0017.flac,PATRICIA WAS THE APPLE OF UNCLE JOHN'S EYE AND THE ONE GODDESS ENSHRINED IN HER DOTING FATHER'S HEART GLANCING AT HER
5390-30096-0018.flac,IN HER PLAIN MUSLIN GOWN A STRANGER WOULD BE TEMPTED TO WONDER WHY SHE WAS RED HAIRED FRECKLED AS A ROBIN'S EGG PUG NOSED AND WIDE MOUTHED BUT HER BLUE EYES WERE BEAUTIFUL
5390-30096-0019.flac,AND THEY SPARKLED WITH A COMBINATION OF SAUCY MISCHIEF AND KINDLY CONSIDERATION FOR OTHERS THAT LENT HER FACE AN INDESCRIBABLE CHARM EVERYONE LOVED PATSY DOYLE
5390-30096-0020.flac,AND PEOPLE WOULD GAZE LONGER AT HER SMILING LIPS AND DANCING EYES THAN UPON MANY A MORE HANDSOME BUT LESS ATTRACTIVE FACE SHE WAS NEARLY SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD NOT VERY TALL AND HER FORM TO SPEAK CHARITABLY
5390-30096-0021.flac,HE WANTED CAPITAL TO PATENT THE PUMP AND PUT IT ON THE MARKET THE THING LOOKED PRETTY GOOD JOHN SO I LENT HIM A THOUSAND OF YOUR MONEY QUITE RIGHT RETURNED UNCLE JOHN NODDING BUT PRETTY SOON HE CAME BACK WITH A SAD TALE
5390-30096-0022.flac,HE WAS IN A BAD FIX ANOTHER FELLOW WAS CONTESTING HIS PATENT AND FIGHTING HARD TO HEAD HIM OFF IT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF MONEY TO FIGHT BACK THREE THOUSAND AT LEAST
5390-30096-0023.flac,BUT HE WAS DECENT ABOUT IT AFTER ALL HIS FATHER HAD LEFT HIM A LITTLE FARM AT MILLVILLE HE COULDN'T SAY WHAT IT WAS WORTH BUT THERE WERE SIXTY ACRES AND SOME GOOD BUILDINGS AND HE WOULD DEED IT TO YOU AS SECURITY
5390-30096-0024.flac,IF YOU WOULD LET HIM HAVE THREE THOUSAND MORE SO YOU TOOK THE FARM AND GAVE HIM THE MONEY I DID SIR PERHAPS I AM TO BLAME
5390-30096-0025.flac,MAKING FIVE THOUSAND IN ALL WELL IT'S GONE JOHN AND YOU'VE GOT THE FARM THE OTHER FELLOWS WERE TOO CLEVER FOR MY YOUNG FRIEND JOSEPH WEGG AND KNOCKED OUT HIS PATENT I'M SO SORRY SAID PATSY SYMPATHETICALLY
5390-30096-0026.flac,HE REPLIED WHAT BECAME OF THE YOUNG MAN ASKED THE GIRL HE'S A COMPETENT CHAUFFEUR AND SO HE WENT TO WORK DRIVING AN AUTOMOBILE WHERE IS MILLVILLE INQUIRED UNCLE JOHN THOUGHTFULLY SOMEWHERE AT THE NORTH OF THE STATE I BELIEVE
5390-30096-0027.flac,HAVE YOU INVESTIGATED THE FARM AT ALL I LOOKED UP A REAL ESTATE DEALER LIVING AT MILLVILLE AND WROTE HIM ABOUT THE WEGG FARM HE SAID IF ANY ONE WANTED THE PLACE VERY BADLY IT MIGHT SELL FOR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS HUMPH
5390-30096-0028.flac,BUT HIS BEST INFORMATION WAS TO THE EFFECT THAT NO ONE WANTED IT AT ALL PATSY LAUGHED POOR UNCLE JOHN SHE SAID THE LITTLE MAN HOWEVER WAS SERIOUS
5390-30096-0029.flac,FOR A TIME HE ATE WITH GREAT DELIBERATION AND REVOLVED AN INTERESTING THOUGHT IN HIS MIND YEARS AGO
5390-30096-0030.flac,BETH IS STILL WITH LOUISE YOU KNOW AND THEY MUST FIND THE CITY DEADLY DULL JUST NOW THE FARM'S THE THING AND THE MAJOR CAN RUN UP TO SEE US FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS IN THE HOT WEATHER AND WE'LL ALL HAVE A GLORIOUS LAZY TIME

5390-30096-0033.flac,IT'S GONE TO RUIN AND DECAY THE LAST FEW YEARS
5390-30102-0000.flac,CHAPTER SEVEN LOUISE SCENTS A MYSTERY LOUISE MERRICK WAS THE ELDEST OF UNCLE JOHN'S NIECES HAVING JUST PASSED HER EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY
5390-30102-0001.flac,LED A MERE BUTTERFLY EXISTENCE HER TWO COUSINS FRANKLY AGREED THAT LOUISE WAS SHALLOW INSINCERE AND INCLINED TO BE AFFECTED BUT OF THE THREE GIRLS
5390-30102-0002.flac,AND MEN USUALLY ADMIRED HER GRACEFUL FIGURE AND HER PIQUANT PRETTY FACE WITH ITS CROWN OF FLUFFY BLONDE HAIR AND WINNING EXPRESSION THERE WAS A RUMOR THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO ARTHUR WELDON
5390-30102-0003.flac,A YOUNG MAN OF POSITION IN THE CITY BUT UNCLE JOHN IGNORED THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING ONE OF HIS CHERISHED NIECES AND DECLARED THAT LOUISE WAS STILL TOO YOUNG TO THINK OF MARRIAGE WHEN AWAY FROM HER FRIVOLOUS MOTHER
5390-30102-0004.flac,AND THE INCONSEQUENT HOME ENVIRONMENTS THE GIRL WAS MORE UNAFFECTED AND NATURAL IN HER WAYS AND HER FAULTS WERE DOUBTLESS MORE THE RESULT OF EDUCATION THAN OF NATURAL TENDENCY ONE THING WAS INDISPUTABLE HOWEVER
5390-30102-0005.flac,LOUISE MERRICK WAS A CLEVER GIRL POSSESSING A QUICK INTELLECT AND A KEEN INSIGHT INTO THE CHARACTER OF OTHERS HER APPARENT SHALLOWNESS WAS A BLIND OF THE SAME CHARACTER AS HER ASSUMED GRACIOUSNESS
5390-30102-0006.flac,AND WHILE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LOVABLE WITHOUT ANY PRETENCE OR SHAM SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN LOUISE MERRICK AND ALLOW OTHERS TO READ HER AS SHE ACTUALLY WAS PATSY AND BETH THOUGHT THEY KNEW HER
5390-30102-0007.flac,AND ADMIRED OR LIKED RATHER THAN LOVED THEIR COUSIN UNCLE JOHN THOUGHT HE KNEW HER TOO AND WAS VERY PROUD OF HIS ELDEST NIECE IN SPITE OF SOME DISCOVERED QUALITIES THAT WERE NOT WHOLLY ADMIRABLE
5390-30102-0008.flac,AN EXTENSIVE COURSE OF LIGHT LITERATURE NOT VOID OF DETECTIVE STORIES HAD AT THIS MOMENT PRIMED LOUISE WITH ITS INFLUENCE TO THE EXTENT OF INDUCING HER TO SCENT A MYSTERY IN THE HISTORY OF CAPTAIN WEGG
5390-30102-0009.flac,THE PLAIN FOLKS AROUND MILLVILLE MIGHT SPECULATE LISTLESSLY UPON THE QUEER DOIN'S AT THE FARM AND NEVER GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE TRUTH INDEED THE STRANGE OCCURRENCES SHE HAD JUST HEARD
5390-30102-0010.flac,WERE NEARLY FORGOTTEN IN THE COMMUNITY AND SOON WOULD BE FORGOTTEN ALTOGETHER UNLESS THE QUICK EAR OF A YOUNG GIRL HAD CAUGHT THE CLUE SO LONG IGNORED AT FIRST SHE SCARCELY APPRECIATED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE UNDERTAKING
5390-30102-0011.flac,IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT AN EFFORT TO READ TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA CAPTAIN'S ROMANCE WOULD BE A CHARMING DIVERSION WHILE SHE RESIDED AT MILLVILLE AND IN UNDERTAKING THE TASK SHE LAUGHINGLY ACCUSED HERSELF OF BECOMING AN AMATEUR DETECTIVE
5390-30102-0012.flac,AN OCCUPATION THAT PROMISED TO BE THRILLING AND DELIGHTFUL WARNED HOWEVER BY THE REBUFF SHE HAD MET WITH FROM UNCLE JOHN THE GIRL DECIDED NOT TO CONFIDE EITHER HER SUSPICIONS OR HER PROPOSED INVESTIGATION TO ANYONE FOR THE PRESENT
5390-30102-0013.flac,LOUISE SET TO WORK TO TABULATE THE INFORMATION SHE HAD RECEIVED THUS FAR NOTING THE ELEMENT OF MYSTERY EACH FACT EVOLVED FIRST CAPTAIN WEGG MUST HAVE BEEN A RICH MAN IN ORDER TO BUILD THIS HOUSE
5390-30102-0014.flac,SECONDLY THE CAPTAIN A SURLY AND SILENT MAN HAD BROUGHT HITHER PERHAPS BY FORCE A YOUNG WOMAN AS HIS WIFE WHO WAS SO UNHAPPY THAT SHE PINED AWAY AND DIED WHO WAS THIS WOMAN
5390-30102-0015.flac,WHAT HAD RENDERED HER SO UNHAPPY AND DESPAIRING THIRDLY THE CAPTAIN'S ONLY FRIEND HAD BEEN A CRAZY MAN NAMED WILL THOMPSON WAS HE CRAZY BEFORE THE CAPTAIN'S DEATH OR HAD HE BECOME CRAZED AT THAT TIME
5390-30102-0016.flac,THE BOY FLED AND LEFT HIS SWEETHEART WITHOUT A WORD WHY UNLESS SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED THAT RENDERED THEIR MARRIAGE IMPOSSIBLE IN THE FIFTH PLACE THERE WAS OLD HUCKS AND HIS BLIND WIFE TO BE CONSIDERED
5390-30102-0017.flac,WHAT DID THEY KNOW ABOUT THEIR OLD MASTER'S SECRET HISTORY WHAT TRAGIC MEMORIES LURKED BENEATH THE MAN'S PERPETUAL SMILE AND THE WOMAN'S COMPOSED AND SIGHTLESS FACE SURELY THERE WAS ENOUGH HERE TO EXCITE THE CURIOSITY
5390-30102-0018.flac,AND WARRANT AN EFFORT TO UNTANGLE THE MYSTERY AND AS INSTRUMENTS TO THE END THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE AVAILABLE WHO COULD BE OF USE TO HER MC NUTT THE AGENT WHO EVIDENTLY KNEW MORE THAN HE HAD CARED TO TELL OLD HUCKS AND HIS WIFE
5390-30102-0019.flac,AND ETHEL THOMPSON THE SCHOOL TEACHER THERE MIGHT BE OTHERS BUT ONE OR ANOTHER OF THESE FOUR MUST KNOW THE TRUTH AND IT WOULD BE HER PLEASANT DUTY TO OBTAIN A FULL DISCLOSURE SO SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO BEGIN HER INVESTIGATIONS AT ONCE
5390-30102-0020.flac,WHEN HER UNCLE RETURNED FROM HIS VISIT TO THE PIGS LOUISE SAID TO HIM I'VE BEEN THINKING DEAR THAT WE OUGHT TO CALL UPON THAT YOUNG LADY WHO ARRANGED OUR ROOMS AND THANK HER FOR HER KINDNESS THAT'S TRUE HE REPLIED
5390-30102-0021.flac,CAN'T WE DRIVE OVER TO THOMPSON'S THIS MORNING UNCLE BETH AND PATSY HAVE PLANNED A TRAMP TO THE LAKE AND A ROW AFTER WATER LILIES THEN LET US MAKE OUR CALL TOGETHER WE CAN INVITE THE GIRL TO COME HERE AND SPEND A DAY WITH US

5390-30102-0027.flac,I UNDERSTAND DAN WELL I DON'T RETURNED UNCLE JOHN IN HIS WHIMSICAL WAY AS HE MOUNTED TO THE SEAT BESIDE HER I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW HE'S HAPPENED TO LIVE SINCE THE LANDING OF COLUMBUS OR WHAT HE'S GOOD FOR
5390-30102-0028.flac,OR WHY SOMEONE DON'T KNOCK HIM ON THE HEAD DAN TURNED HIS LONG LEAN FACE AS IF TO GIVE THE SPEAKER A REPROACHFUL LOOK THEN HE GROANED AGAIN LEANED FORWARD AND DREW THE BUGGY SLOWLY INTO THE STONY LANE
5390-30102-0029.flac,DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE THOMPSONS LIVE INQUIRED UNCLE JOHN NO WHOA DAN THAT WAS THE BEST THING THE NAG DID HE KNEW HOW TO WHOA THOMAS CALLED UNCLE JOHN TURNING IN HIS SEAT

226-131532-0000.flac,WHEN ALL WERE GONE I LEARNT THAT THE VILE SLANDER HAD INDEED BEEN CIRCULATED THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY IN THE VERY PRESENCE OF THE VICTIM ROSE HOWEVER VOWED SHE DID NOT AND WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT
226-131532-0001.flac,AND MY MOTHER MADE THE SAME DECLARATION THOUGH NOT I FEAR WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF REAL UNWAVERING INCREDULITY IT SEEMED TO DWELL CONTINUALLY ON HER MIND AND SHE KEPT IRRITATING ME FROM TIME TO TIME BY SUCH EXPRESSIONS AS
226-131532-0002.flac,THE FOUNDATION IS IN THE WICKEDNESS AND FALSEHOOD OF THE WORLD SAID I AND IN THE FACT THAT MISTER LAWRENCE HAS BEEN SEEN TO GO THAT WAY ONCE OR TWICE OF AN EVENING AND THE VILLAGE GOSSIPS SAY HE GOES TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE STRANGE LADY
226-131532-0003.flac,AND THE SCANDAL MONGERS HAVE GREEDILY SEIZED THE RUMOUR TO MAKE IT THE BASIS OF THEIR OWN INFERNAL STRUCTURE WELL BUT GILBERT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN HER MANNER TO COUNTENANCE SUCH REPORTS DID YOU SEE ANYTHING IN HER MANNER
226-131532-0004.flac,NO CERTAINLY BUT THEN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT HER I BELIEVE IT WAS ON THAT VERY EVENING THAT I VENTURED ON ANOTHER INVASION OF WILDFELL HALL FROM THE TIME OF OUR PARTY
226-131532-0005.flac,WHICH WAS UPWARDS OF A WEEK AGO I HAD BEEN MAKING DAILY EFFORTS TO MEET ITS MISTRESS IN HER WALKS AND ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED SHE MUST HAVE MANAGED IT SO ON PURPOSE HAD NIGHTLY KEPT REVOLVING IN MY MIND SOME PRETEXT FOR ANOTHER CALL
226-131532-0006.flac,AT LENGTH I CONCLUDED THAT THE SEPARATION COULD BE ENDURED NO LONGER BY THIS TIME YOU WILL SEE I WAS PRETTY FAR GONE AND TAKING FROM THE BOOK CASE AN OLD VOLUME THAT I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN
226-131532-0007.flac,THOUGH FROM ITS UNSIGHTLY AND SOMEWHAT DILAPIDATED CONDITION I HAD NOT YET VENTURED TO OFFER IT FOR PERUSAL I HASTENED AWAY BUT NOT WITHOUT SUNDRY MISGIVINGS AS TO HOW SHE WOULD RECEIVE ME
226-131532-0008.flac,OR HOW I COULD SUMMON COURAGE TO PRESENT MYSELF WITH SO SLIGHT AN EXCUSE BUT PERHAPS I MIGHT SEE HER IN THE FIELD OR THE GARDEN AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IT WAS THE FORMAL KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
226-131532-0009.flac,WITH THE PROSPECT OF BEING GRAVELY USHERED IN BY RACHEL TO THE PRESENCE OF A SURPRISED UNCORDIAL MISTRESS THAT SO GREATLY DISTURBED ME MY WISH HOWEVER WAS NOT GRATIFIED
226-131532-0010.flac,MISSUS GRAHAM HERSELF WAS NOT TO BE SEEN BUT THERE WAS ARTHUR PLAYING WITH HIS FROLICSOME LITTLE DOG IN THE GARDEN I LOOKED OVER THE GATE AND CALLED HIM TO ME HE WANTED ME TO COME IN BUT I TOLD HIM I COULD NOT WITHOUT HIS MOTHER'S LEAVE
226-131532-0011.flac,HE RAN TO PERFORM MY BIDDING AND QUICKLY RETURNED WITH HIS MOTHER HOW LOVELY SHE LOOKED WITH HER DARK RINGLETS STREAMING IN THE LIGHT SUMMER BREEZE HER FAIR CHEEK SLIGHTLY FLUSHED AND HER COUNTENANCE RADIANT WITH SMILES
226-131532-0012.flac,THERE IS NO MEDIATOR LIKE A MERRY SIMPLE HEARTED CHILD EVER READY TO CEMENT DIVIDED HEARTS TO SPAN THE UNFRIENDLY GULF OF CUSTOM TO MELT THE ICE OF COLD RESERVE AND OVERTHROW THE SEPARATING WALLS OF DREAD FORMALITY AND PRIDE
226-131532-0013.flac,WELL MISTER MARKHAM WHAT IS IT SAID THE YOUNG MOTHER ACCOSTING ME WITH A PLEASANT SMILE I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THIS BOOK AND IF YOU PLEASE TO TAKE IT AND PERUSE IT AT YOUR LEISURE

226-131532-0015.flac,I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GARDEN AND HOW YOUR SISTER'S ROOTS HAVE PROSPERED IN MY CHARGE ADDED SHE AS SHE OPENED THE GATE AND WE SAUNTERED THROUGH THE GARDEN AND TALKED OF THE FLOWERS THE TREES AND THE BOOK
226-131532-0016.flac,AND THEN OF OTHER THINGS THE EVENING WAS KIND AND GENIAL AND SO WAS MY COMPANION BY DEGREES I WAXED MORE WARM AND TENDER THAN PERHAPS I HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
226-131532-0017.flac,BUT STILL I SAID NOTHING TANGIBLE AND SHE ATTEMPTED NO REPULSE UNTIL IN PASSING A MOSS ROSE TREE THAT I HAD BROUGHT HER SOME WEEKS SINCE IN MY SISTER'S NAME
226-131532-0018.flac,AND I SAW A FLASH OF ECSTATIC BRILLIANCE IN HER EYE A GLOW OF GLAD EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE I THOUGHT MY HOUR OF VICTORY WAS COME BUT INSTANTLY A PAINFUL RECOLLECTION SEEMED TO FLASH UPON HER
226-131532-0019.flac,A CLOUD OF ANGUISH DARKENED HER BROW A MARBLE PALENESS BLANCHED HER CHEEK AND LIP THERE SEEMED A MOMENT OF INWARD CONFLICT AND WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT SHE WITHDREW HER HAND AND RETREATED A STEP OR TWO BACK
226-131532-0020.flac,NOW MISTER MARKHAM SAID SHE WITH A KIND OF DESPERATE CALMNESS I MUST TELL YOU PLAINLY THAT I CANNOT DO WITH THIS I LIKE YOUR COMPANY BECAUSE I AM ALONE HERE

226-131532-0026.flac,BUT AS I WENT THE TRAMP OF HORSES HOOFS FELL ON MY EAR AND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE DEWY EVENING AND LOOKING TOWARDS THE LANE I SAW A SOLITARY EQUESTRIAN COMING UP INCLINING TO DUSK AS IT WAS
226-131532-0027.flac,AND SEEMED INCLINED TO TURN BACK BUT ON SECOND THOUGHT APPARENTLY JUDGED IT BETTER TO CONTINUE HIS COURSE AS BEFORE HE ACCOSTED ME WITH A SLIGHT BOW AND EDGING CLOSE TO THE WALL ENDEAVOURED TO PASS ON BUT I WAS NOT SO MINDED
226-131532-0028.flac,YOU AND YOUR PONY BE WHAT MAKES YOU SO COARSE AND BRUTAL MARKHAM I'M QUITE ASHAMED OF YOU YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS SPOT I WILL KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS PERFIDIOUS DUPLICITY

226-131532-0031.flac,AND IN TRUTH THE VICAR WAS JUST BEHIND ME PLODDING HOMEWARD FROM SOME REMOTE CORNER OF HIS PARISH I IMMEDIATELY RELEASED THE SQUIRE AND HE WENT ON HIS WAY SALUTING MISTER MILLWARD AS HE PASSED
226-131532-0032.flac,WHAT QUARRELLING MARKHAM CRIED THE LATTER ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO ME
226-131532-0033.flac,BUT LET ME TELL YOU YOUNG MAN HERE HE PUT HIS FACE INTO MINE WITH AN IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL AIR SHE'S NOT WORTH IT AND HE CONFIRMED THE ASSERTION BY A SOLEMN NOD
226-131532-0034.flac,WITH A LOOK THAT PLAINLY SAID WHAT THIS TO ME
226-131533-0000.flac,YOU MUST SUPPOSE ABOUT THREE WEEKS PASSED OVER MISSUS GRAHAM AND I WERE NOW ESTABLISHED FRIENDS OR BROTHER AND SISTER AS WE RATHER CHOSE TO CONSIDER OURSELVES
226-131533-0001.flac,SHE CALLED ME GILBERT BY MY EXPRESS DESIRE AND I CALLED HER HELEN FOR I HAD SEEN THAT NAME WRITTEN IN HER BOOKS I SELDOM ATTEMPTED TO SEE HER ABOVE TWICE A WEEK
226-131533-0002.flac,AND STILL I MADE OUR MEETINGS APPEAR THE RESULT OF ACCIDENT AS OFTEN AS I COULD FOR I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL AND ALTOGETHER I BEHAVED WITH SUCH EXCEEDING PROPRIETY THAT SHE NEVER HAD OCCASION TO REPROVE ME ONCE
226-131533-0003.flac,YET I COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THAT SHE WAS AT TIMES UNHAPPY AND DISSATISFIED WITH HERSELF OR HER POSITION AND TRULY I MYSELF WAS NOT QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE LATTER THIS ASSUMPTION OF BROTHERLY NONCHALANCE WAS VERY HARD TO SUSTAIN
226-131533-0004.flac,AND I OFTEN FELT MYSELF A MOST CONFOUNDED HYPOCRITE WITH IT ALL I SAW TOO OR RATHER I FELT THAT IN SPITE OF HERSELF I WAS NOT INDIFFERENT TO HER AS THE NOVEL HEROES MODESTLY EXPRESS IT
226-131533-0005.flac,AND WHILE I THANKFULLY ENJOYED MY PRESENT GOOD FORTUNE I COULD NOT FAIL TO WISH AND HOPE FOR SOMETHING BETTER IN FUTURE BUT OF COURSE I KEPT SUCH DREAMS ENTIRELY TO MYSELF
226-131533-0006.flac,YOU'RE GOING TO WILDFELL HALL AREN'T YOU WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO BECAUSE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE BUT I WISH YOU WOULDN'T GO SO OFTEN NONSENSE CHILD I DON'T GO ONCE IN SIX WEEKS WHAT DO YOU MEAN
226-131533-0007.flac,WELL BUT IF I WERE YOU I WOULDN'T HAVE SO MUCH TO DO WITH MISSUS GRAHAM WHY ROSE ARE YOU TOO GIVING IN TO THE PREVAILING OPINION NO RETURNED SHE HESITATINGLY
226-131533-0008.flac,BOTH AT THE WILSONS AND THE VICARAGE AND BESIDES MAMMA SAYS IF SHE WERE A PROPER PERSON SHE WOULD NOT BE LIVING THERE BY HERSELF AND DON'T YOU REMEMBER LAST WINTER GILBERT ALL THAT ABOUT THE FALSE NAME TO THE PICTURE
226-131533-0009.flac,AND HOW SHE EXPLAINED IT SAYING SHE HAD FRIENDS OR ACQUAINTANCES FROM WHOM SHE WISHED HER PRESENT RESIDENCE TO BE CONCEALED AND THAT SHE WAS AFRAID OF THEIR TRACING HER OUT AND THEN HOW SUDDENLY SHE STARTED UP AND LEFT THE ROOM WHEN THAT PERSON CAME
226-131533-0010.flac,WHOM SHE TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO LET US CATCH A GLIMPSE OF AND WHO ARTHUR WITH SUCH AN AIR OF MYSTERY TOLD US WAS HIS MAMMA'S FRIEND YES ROSE I REMEMBER IT ALL AND I CAN FORGIVE YOUR UNCHARITABLE CONCLUSIONS
226-131533-0011.flac,FOR PERHAPS IF I DID NOT KNOW HER MYSELF I SHOULD PUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND BELIEVE THE SAME AS YOU DO BUT THANK GOD I DO KNOW HER AND I SHOULD BE UNWORTHY THE NAME OF A MAN IF I COULD BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID AGAINST HER
226-131533-0012.flac,UNLESS I HEARD IT FROM HER OWN LIPS I SHOULD AS SOON BELIEVE SUCH THINGS OF YOU ROSE OH GILBERT WELL
226-131533-0013.flac,YOU KNOW NOTHING OF HER FORMER LIFE AND LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT SUCH A PERSON EXISTED NO MATTER THERE IS SUCH A THING AS LOOKING THROUGH A PERSON'S EYES INTO THE HEART AND LEARNING MORE OF THE HEIGHT AND BREADTH
226-131533-0014.flac,AND DEPTH OF ANOTHER'S SOUL IN ONE HOUR THAN IT MIGHT TAKE YOU A LIFETIME TO DISCOVER IF HE OR SHE WERE NOT DISPOSED TO REVEAL IT OR IF YOU HAD NOT THE SENSE TO UNDERSTAND IT THEN YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HER THIS EVENING
226-131533-0015.flac,MISSUS GRAHAM AND I ARE TWO FRIENDS AND WILL BE AND NO MAN BREATHING SHALL HINDER IT OR HAS A RIGHT TO INTERFERE BETWEEN US BUT IF YOU KNEW HOW THEY TALK YOU WOULD BE MORE CAREFUL FOR HER SAKE AS WELL AS FOR YOUR OWN
226-131533-0016.flac,JANE WILSON THINKS YOUR VISITS TO THE OLD HALL BUT ANOTHER PROOF OF HER DEPRAVITY CONFOUND JANE WILSON AND ELIZA MILLWARD IS QUITE GRIEVED ABOUT YOU I HOPE SHE IS
226-131533-0017.flac,BUT I WOULDN'T IF I WERE YOU WOULDN'T WHAT HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT I GO THERE THERE'S NOTHING HID FROM THEM THEY SPY OUT EVERYTHING OH I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS
226-131533-0018.flac,AND SO THEY DARE TO TURN MY FRIENDSHIP INTO FOOD FOR FURTHER SCANDAL AGAINST HER THAT PROVES THE FALSEHOOD OF THEIR OTHER LIES AT ALL EVENTS IF ANY PROOF WERE WANTING MIND YOU CONTRADICT THEM ROSE WHENEVER YOU CAN
226-131533-0019.flac,BUT THEY DON'T SPEAK OPENLY TO ME ABOUT SUCH THINGS IT IS ONLY BY HINTS AND INNUENDOES AND BY WHAT I HEAR OTHERS SAY THAT I KNEW WHAT THEY THINK WELL THEN I WON'T GO TO DAY AS IT'S GETTING LATISH
226-131533-0020.flac,AFTER HIS CUSTOMARY CHEERFUL AND FATHERLY GREETING OF ROSE WHO WAS RATHER A FAVOURITE WITH THE OLD GENTLEMAN HE TURNED SOMEWHAT STERNLY TO ME WELL SIR SAID HE YOU'RE QUITE A STRANGER IT IS
226-131533-0021.flac,AS HE DEPOSITED HIS PONDEROUS BULK IN THE ARM CHAIR THAT ROSE OFFICIOUSLY BROUGHT TOWARDS HIM IT IS JUST SIX WEEKS BY MY RECKONING SINCE YOU DARKENED MY DOOR HE SPOKE IT WITH EMPHASIS AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR
226-131533-0022.flac,IS IT SIR SAID I AY IT IS SO HE ADDED AN AFFIRMATORY NOD AND CONTINUED TO GAZE UPON ME WITH A KIND OF IRATE SOLEMNITY HOLDING HIS SUBSTANTIAL STICK BETWEEN HIS KNEES
226-131533-0023.flac,WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED UPON ITS HEAD I HAVE BEEN BUSY I SAID FOR AN APOLOGY WAS EVIDENTLY DEMANDED BUSY REPEATED HE DERISIVELY YES YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN GETTING IN MY HAY
226-131533-0024.flac,IN TIME FOR TEA BUT OFFERED TO HAVE SOME IMMEDIATELY PREPARED IF HE WOULD DO HER THE FAVOUR TO PARTAKE OF IT NOT ANY FOR ME I THANK YOU REPLIED HE I SHALL BE AT HOME IN A FEW MINUTES OH BUT DO STAY AND TAKE A LITTLE
226-131533-0025.flac,IT WILL BE READY IN FIVE MINUTES BUT HE REJECTED THE OFFER WITH A MAJESTIC WAVE OF THE HAND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL TAKE MISSUS MARKHAM SAID HE I'LL TAKE A GLASS OF YOUR EXCELLENT ALE
226-131533-0026.flac,WITH PLEASURE CRIED MY MOTHER PROCEEDING WITH ALACRITY TO PULL THE BELL AND ORDER THE FAVOURED BEVERAGE I THOUGHT CONTINUED HE I'D JUST LOOK IN UPON YOU AS I PASSED AND TASTE YOUR HOME BREWED ALE
226-131533-0027.flac,REALLY EJACULATED MY MOTHER WHY SO MISTER MILLWARD ASKED I HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SOME SEVERITY AND TURNING AGAIN TO MY MOTHER REPEATED
226-131533-0028.flac,AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR AGAIN MY MOTHER SAT OPPOSITE AN AWE STRUCK BUT ADMIRING AUDITOR MISSUS GRAHAM SAID I HE CONTINUED SHAKING HIS HEAD AS HE SPOKE
226-131533-0029.flac,THESE ARE TERRIBLE REPORTS WHAT SIR SAYS SHE AFFECTING TO BE IGNORANT OF MY MEANING IT IS MY DUTY AS YOUR PASTOR SAID I TO TELL YOU BOTH EVERYTHING THAT I MYSELF SEE REPREHENSIBLE IN YOUR CONDUCT
226-131533-0030.flac,AND ALL I HAVE REASON TO SUSPECT AND WHAT OTHERS TELL ME CONCERNING YOU SO I TOLD HER YOU DID SIR CRIED I STARTING FROM MY SEAT AND STRIKING MY FIST ON THE TABLE
226-131533-0031.flac,BUT SHE OFFERED NO EXTENUATION OR DEFENCE AND WITH A KIND OF SHAMELESS CALMNESS SHOCKING INDEED TO WITNESS IN ONE SO YOUNG AS GOOD AS TOLD ME THAT MY REMONSTRANCE WAS UNAVAILING AND MY PASTORAL ADVICE QUITE THROWN AWAY UPON HER
226-131533-0032.flac,NAY THAT MY VERY PRESENCE WAS DISPLEASING WHILE I SPOKE SUCH THINGS AND I WITHDREW AT LENGTH TOO PLAINLY SEEING THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE AND SADLY GRIEVED TO FIND HER CASE SO HOPELESS
226-131533-0033.flac,BUT I AM FULLY DETERMINED MISSUS MARKHAM THAT MY DAUGHTERS SHALL NOT CONSORT WITH HER DO YOU ADOPT THE SAME RESOLUTION WITH REGARD TO YOURS AS FOR YOUR SONS AS FOR YOU YOUNG MAN HE CONTINUED STERNLY TURNING TO ME
226-131533-0034.flac,SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND ME WITH A BANG THAT SHOOK THE HOUSE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS AND MADE MY MOTHER SCREAM AND GAVE A MOMENTARY RELIEF TO MY EXCITED FEELINGS
226-131533-0035.flac,THE NEXT MINUTE SAW ME HURRYING WITH RAPID STRIDES IN THE DIRECTION OF WILDFELL HALL TO WHAT INTENT OR PURPOSE I COULD SCARCELY TELL BUT I MUST BE MOVING SOMEWHERE AND NO OTHER GOAL WOULD DO
226-131533-0036.flac,I MUST SEE HER TOO AND SPEAK TO HER THAT WAS CERTAIN BUT WHAT TO SAY OR HOW TO ACT I HAD NO DEFINITE IDEA

5456-58161-0027.flac,WILL SHIVER UPON THE BANKS OF THE STYX QUITE AS HELPLESS AS THEY WERE BORN NAKED SOULS AND VERY FORLORN THE PRINCESS THEN MUST SHIFT FOR HERSELF AND LAY HER ROYALTY ON THE SHELF SHE AND THE BEAUTIFUL EMPRESS YONDER WHOSE ROBES ARE NOW THE WIDE WORLD'S WONDER
5456-58161-0028.flac,WHO CALICO WEAR EACH MORN OF THEIR LIVES AND THE SEWING GIRLS AND LES CHIFFONNIERS IN RAGS AND HUNGER A GAUNT ARRAY AND ALL THE GROOMS OF THE CARAVAN
5456-62043-0000.flac,A BULLY BOAT AND A BRAG CAPTAIN A STORY OF STEAMBOAT LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI BY SOL SMITH DOES ANY ONE REMEMBER THE CARAVAN SHE WAS WHAT WOULD NOW BE CONSIDERED A SLOW BOAT THEN EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN
5456-62043-0001.flac,SHE WAS REGULARLY ADVERTISED AS THE FAST RUNNING ET CETERA HER REGULAR TRIPS FROM NEW ORLEANS TO NATCHEZ WERE USUALLY MADE IN FROM SIX TO EIGHT DAYS A TRIP MADE BY HER IN FIVE DAYS WAS CONSIDERED REMARKABLE
5456-62043-0002.flac,A VOYAGE FROM NEW ORLEANS TO VICKSBURG AND BACK INCLUDING STOPPAGES GENERALLY ENTITLED THE OFFICERS AND CREW TO A MONTH'S WAGES WHETHER THE CARAVAN EVER ACHIEVED THE FEAT OF A VOYAGE TO THE FALLS LOUISVILLE I HAVE NEVER LEARNED IF SHE DID
5456-62043-0003.flac,SHE MUST HAVE HAD A TIME OF IT IT WAS MY FATE TO TAKE PASSAGE IN THIS BOAT THE CAPTAIN WAS A GOOD NATURED EASY GOING MAN CAREFUL OF THE COMFORT OF HIS PASSENGERS AND EXCEEDINGLY FOND OF THE GAME OF BRAG WE HAD BEEN OUT A LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE DAYS
5456-62043-0004.flac,AND WE WERE IN HOPES OF SEEING THE BLUFFS OF NATCHEZ ON THE NEXT DAY OUR WOOD WAS GETTING LOW AND NIGHT COMING ON THE PILOT ON DUTY ABOVE THE OTHER PILOT HELD THREE ACES AT THE TIME AND WAS JUST CALLING OUT THE CAPTAIN WHO WENT IT STRONG ON THREE KINGS
5456-62043-0005.flac,SENT DOWN WORD THAT THE MATE HAD REPORTED THE STOCK OF WOOD REDUCED TO HALF A CORD THE WORTHY CAPTAIN EXCUSED HIMSELF TO THE PILOT WHOSE WATCH WAS BELOW AND THE TWO PASSENGERS WHO MADE UP THE PARTY AND HURRIED TO THE DECK
5456-62043-0006.flac,WHICH HE SAID WAS SITUATED RIGHT ROUND YONDER POINT BUT MUTTERED THE CAPTAIN I DON'T MUCH LIKE TO TAKE WOOD OF THE YELLOW FACED OLD SCOUNDREL WHO OWNS IT HE ALWAYS CHARGES A QUARTER OF A DOLLAR MORE THAN ANY ONE ELSE HOWEVER THERE'S NO OTHER CHANCE
5456-62043-0007.flac,AND IN A LITTLE LESS THAN AN HOUR WHEN OUR FUEL WAS ABOUT GIVING OUT WE MADE THE POINT AND OUR CABLES WERE OUT AND FASTENED TO TREES ALONGSIDE OF A GOOD SIZED WOOD PILE HALLO COLONEL HOW D'YE SELL YOUR WOOD THIS TIME A YELLOW FACED OLD GENTLEMAN
5456-62043-0008.flac,WITH A TWO WEEKS BEARD STRINGS OVER HIS SHOULDERS HOLDING UP TO HIS ARMPITS A PAIR OF COPPERAS COLORED LINSEY WOOLSEY PANTS THE LEGS OF WHICH REACHED A VERY LITTLE BELOW THE KNEE SHOES WITHOUT STOCKINGS A FADED BROAD BRIMMED HAT WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN BLACK
5456-62043-0009.flac,AND A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH CASTING A GLANCE AT THE EMPTY GUARDS OF OUR BOAT AND UTTERING A GRUNT AS HE ROSE FROM FASTENING OUR SPRING LINE ANSWERED WHY CAPTING WE MUST CHARGE YOU THREE AND A QUARTER THIS TIME THE D L REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
5456-62043-0010.flac,WHAT'S THE ODD QUARTER FOR I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOU ONLY CHARGED ME THREE AS I WENT DOWN WHY CAPTAING DRAWLED OUT THE WOOD MERCHANT WITH A SORT OF LEER ON HIS YELLOW COUNTENANCE WHICH CLEARLY INDICATED THAT HIS WOOD WAS AS GOOD AS SOLD
5456-62043-0011.flac,WOOD'S RIZ SINCE YOU WENT DOWN TWO WEEKS AGO BESIDES YOU ARE AWAR THAT YOU VERY SELDOM STOP GOING DOWN
5456-62043-0012.flac,AND THERE'S NO OTHER WOODYARD FOR NINE MILES AHEAD AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE NEARLY OUT OF FOOEL WHY WELL WELL INTERRUPTED THE CAPTAIN WE'LL TAKE A FEW CORDS UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND HE RETURNED TO HIS GAME OF BRAG
5456-62043-0013.flac,IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WE FELT THE CARAVAN COMMENCE PADDLING AGAIN SUPPER WAS OVER
5456-62043-0014.flac,SITUATED ALONGSIDE AND OVERLOOKING THE BRAG TABLE WHERE THE CAPTAIN WAS DEEPLY ENGAGED HAVING NOW THE OTHER PILOT AS HIS PRINCIPAL OPPONENT WE JOGGED ON QUIETLY AND SEEMED TO BE GOING AT A GOOD RATE
5456-62043-0015.flac,HOW DOES THAT WOOD BURN INQUIRED THE CAPTAIN OF THE MATE WHO WAS LOOKING ON AT THE GAME TISN'T OF MUCH ACCOUNT I RECKON ANSWERED THE MATE IT'S COTTONWOOD AND MOST OF IT GREEN AT THAT WELL THOMPSON THREE ACES AGAIN STRANGER
5456-62043-0016.flac,THOMPSON I SAY WE'D BETTER TAKE THREE OR FOUR CORDS AT THE NEXT WOODYARD IT CAN'T BE MORE THAN SIX MILES FROM HERE TWO ACES AND A BRAGGER WITH THE AGE
5456-62043-0017.flac,THE GAME WENT ON AND THE PADDLES KEPT MOVING AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK IT WAS REPORTED TO THE CAPTAIN THAT WE WERE NEARING THE WOODYARD THE LIGHT BEING DISTINCTLY SEEN BY THE PILOT ON DUTY HEAD HER IN SHORE THEN AND TAKE IN SIX CORDS IF IT'S GOOD SEE TO IT THOMPSON
5456-62043-0018.flac,I CAN'T VERY WELL LEAVE THE GAME NOW IT'S GETTING RIGHT WARM THIS PILOT'S BEATING US ALL TO SMASH THE WOODING COMPLETED WE PADDLED ON AGAIN THE CAPTAIN SEEMED SOMEWHAT VEXED WHEN THE MATE INFORMED HIM THAT THE PRICE WAS THE SAME AS AT THE LAST WOODYARD
5456-62043-0019.flac,THREE AND A QUARTER BUT SOON AGAIN BECAME INTERESTED IN THE GAME FROM MY UPPER BERTH THERE WERE NO STATE ROOMS THEN I COULD OBSERVE THE MOVEMENTS OF THE PLAYERS
5456-62043-0020.flac,THE LATTER PERSONAGES TOOK IT TURN AND TURN ABOUT STEERING AND PLAYING BRAG ONE OF THEM ALMOST INVARIABLY WINNING WHILE THE TWO PASSENGERS MERELY WENT THROUGH THE CEREMONY OF DEALING CUTTING AND PAYING UP THEIR ANTIES THEY WERE ANXIOUS TO LEARN THE GAME
5456-62043-0021.flac,AND THEY DID LEARN IT ONCE IN A WHILE INDEED SEEING THEY HAD TWO ACES AND A BRAGGER THEY WOULD VENTURE A BET OF FIVE OR TEN DOLLARS BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS COMPELLED TO BACK OUT BEFORE THE TREMENDOUS BRAGGING OF THE CAPTAIN OR PILOT
5456-62043-0022.flac,OR IF THEY DID VENTURE TO CALL OUT ON TWO BULLITS AND A BRAGGER THEY HAD THE MORTIFICATION TO FIND ONE OF THE OFFICERS HAD THE SAME KIND OF A HAND AND WERE MORE VENERABLE STILL WITH ALL THESE DISADVANTAGES THEY CONTINUED PLAYING
5456-62043-0023.flac,THEY WANTED TO LEARN THE GAME AT TWO O'CLOCK THE CAPTAIN ASKED THE MATE HOW WE WERE GETTING ON OH PRETTY GLIBLY SIR REPLIED THE MATE WE CAN SCARCELY TELL WHAT HEADWAY WE ARE MAKING FOR WE ARE OBLIGED TO KEEP THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER AND THERE IS THE SHADOW OF A FOG RISING
5456-62043-0024.flac,THIS WOOD SEEMS RATHER BETTER THAN THAT WE TOOK IN AT YELLOW FACE'S BUT WE'RE NEARLY OUT AGAIN AND MUST BE LOOKING OUT FOR MORE I SAW A LIGHT JUST AHEAD ON THE RIGHT SHALL WE HAIL YES YES REPLIED THE CAPTAIN RING THE BELL AND ASK EM WHAT'S THE PRICE OF WOOD UP HERE I'VE GOT YOU AGAIN
5456-62043-0025.flac,I HEARD THE BELL AND THE PILOT'S HAIL WHAT'S YOUR PRICE FOR WOOD A YOUTHFUL VOICE ON THE SHORE ANSWERED THREE AND A QUARTER D NET EJACULATED THE CAPTAIN
5456-62043-0026.flac,THE STRANGERS SUFFERING SOME AT THE SAME TIME THREE AND A QUARTER AGAIN ARE WE NEVER TO GET TO A CHEAPER COUNTRY DEAL SIR IF YOU PLEASE BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME THE OTHER PILOT'S VOICE WAS AGAIN HEARD ON DECK HOW MUCH HAVE YOU ONLY ABOUT TEN CORDS SIR
5456-62043-0027.flac,WAS THE REPLY OF THE YOUTHFUL SALESMAN THE CAPTAIN HERE TOLD THOMPSON TO TAKE SIX CORDS WHICH WOULD LAST TILL DAYLIGHT AND AGAIN TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE GAME THE PILOTS HERE CHANGED PLACES WHEN DID THEY SLEEP WOOD TAKEN IN
5456-62043-0028.flac,THE CARAVAN AGAIN TOOK HER PLACE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM PADDLING ON AS USUAL DAY AT LENGTH DAWNED THE BRAG PARTY BROKE UP AND SETTLEMENTS WERE BEING MADE DURING WHICH OPERATION
5456-62043-0029.flac,THE CAPTAIN'S BRAGGING PROPENSITIES WERE EXERCISED IN CRACKING UP THE SPEED OF HIS BOAT WHICH BY HIS RECKONING
5456-62043-0030.flac,IT APPEARS THE TWO PASSENGERS IN THEIR FIRST LESSON HAD INCIDENTALLY LOST ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS THE CAPTAIN AS HE ROSE TO SEE ABOUT TAKING IN SOME GOOD WOOD WHICH HE FELT SURE OF OBTAINING NOW THAT HE HAD GOT ABOVE THE LEVEL COUNTRY WINKED AT HIS OPPONENT
5456-62043-0031.flac,THE PILOT WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN ON VERY BAD TERMS DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE GAME AND SAID IN AN UNDERTONE FORTY APIECE FOR YOU AND I AND JAMES THE OTHER PILOT IS NOT BAD FOR ONE NIGHT I HAD RISEN AND WENT OUT WITH THE CAPTAIN TO ENJOY A VIEW OF THE BLUFFS
5456-62043-0032.flac,THERE WAS JUST FOG ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE VISION TAKING IN MORE THAN SIXTY YARDS SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN MY EXPECTATION WE WERE NEARING THE SHORE FOR THE PURPOSE OF LOOKING FOR WOOD THE BANKS BEING INVISIBLE FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER THERE IT IS EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN STOP HER
5456-62043-0033.flac,AND THE CAPTAIN HAILED HALLO THE WOODYARD HALLO YOURSELF ANSWERED A SQUEAKING FEMALE VOICE WHICH CAME FROM A WOMAN WITH A PETTICOAT OVER HER SHOULDERS IN PLACE OF A SHAWL WHAT'S THE PRICE OF WOOD
5456-62043-0034.flac,I THINK YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THE PRICE BY THIS TIME ANSWERED THE OLD LADY IN THE PETTICOAT
5456-62043-0035.flac,AND NOW YOU KNOW IT THREE AND THE D L BROKE IN THE CAPTAIN WHAT HAVE YOU RAISED ON YOUR WOOD TOO I'LL GIVE YOU THREE AND NOT A CENT MORE WELL REPLIED THE PETTICOAT HERE COMES THE OLD MAN HE'LL TALK TO YOU AND SURE ENOUGH
5456-62043-0036.flac,OUT CREPT FROM THE COTTAGE THE VERITABLE FADED HAT COPPERAS COLORED PANTS YELLOW COUNTENANCE AND TWO WEEKS BEARD WE HAD SEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
5456-62043-0037.flac,ACCOMPANIED BY THE SAME LEER OF THE SAME YELLOW COUNTENANCE WHY DARN IT ALL CAPTING THERE IS BUT THREE OR FOUR CORDS LEFT AND SINCE IT'S YOU I DON'T CARE IF I DO LET YOU HAVE IT FOR THREE AS YOU'RE A GOOD CUSTOMER
5456-62043-0038.flac,AND TURNED IN TO TAKE SOME REST THE FACT BECAME APPARENT THE READER WILL PROBABLY HAVE DISCOVERED IT SOME TIME SINCE
5456-24741-0000.flac,THE IDEA OF EVERY MODE IN WHICH THE HUMAN BODY IS AFFECTED BY EXTERNAL BODIES
5456-24741-0001.flac,PROOF ALL THE MODES IN WHICH ANY GIVEN BODY IS AFFECTED
5456-24741-0002.flac,WHEREFORE THEIR IDEA ALSO NECESSARILY
5456-24741-0003.flac,THEREFORE THE IDEA OF EVERY MODE IN WHICH THE HUMAN BODY IS AFFECTED BY EXTERNAL BODIES INVOLVES THE NATURE OF THE HUMAN BODY AND OF THE EXTERNAL BODY
5456-24741-0004.flac,HENCE IT FOLLOWS FIRST THAT THE HUMAN MIND PERCEIVES THE NATURE OF A VARIETY OF BODIES TOGETHER WITH THE NATURE OF ITS OWN
5456-24741-0005.flac,IT WILL HAVE THE IDEA OF THE MODE AS ACTUALLY EXISTING
5456-24741-0006.flac,IN OTHER WORDS IT WILL HAVE THE IDEA WHICH DOES NOT EXCLUDE BUT POSTULATES THE EXISTENCE OR PRESENCE OF THE NATURE OF THE EXTERNAL BODY
5456-24741-0007.flac,WILL REGARD THE EXTERNAL BODY AS ACTUALLY EXISTING
5456-24741-0008.flac,COROLLARY THE MIND IS ABLE TO REGARD AS PRESENT EXTERNAL BODIES BY WHICH THE HUMAN BODY HAS ONCE BEEN AFFECTED EVEN THOUGH THEY BE NO LONGER IN EXISTENCE OR PRESENT
5456-24741-0009.flac,BY WHICH THE HUMAN BODY HAS ONCE BEEN AFFECTED BE NO LONGER IN EXISTENCE THE MIND WILL NEVERTHELESS REGARD THEM AS PRESENT AS OFTEN AS THIS ACTION OF THE BODY IS REPEATED
5456-24741-0010.flac,NOTE WE THUS SEE HOW IT COMES ABOUT
5456-24741-0011.flac,THE LATTER INDICATES RATHER THE DISPOSITION OF PAUL'S BODY THAN THE NATURE OF PETER AND THEREFORE WHILE THIS DISPOSITION OF PAUL'S BODY LASTS PAUL'S MIND WILL REGARD PETER AS PRESENT TO ITSELF EVEN THOUGH HE NO LONGER EXISTS FURTHER TO RETAIN THE USUAL PHRASEOLOGY
5456-24741-0012.flac,THE MODIFICATIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY OF WHICH THE IDEAS REPRESENT EXTERNAL BODIES AS PRESENT TO US WE WILL CALL THE IMAGES OF THINGS THOUGH THEY DO NOT RECALL THE FIGURE OF THINGS WHEN THE MIND REGARDS BODIES IN THIS FASHION WE SAY THAT IT IMAGINES
5456-24741-0013.flac,LOOKED AT IN THEMSELVES DO NOT CONTAIN ERROR THE MIND DOES NOT ERR IN THE MERE ACT OF IMAGINING BUT ONLY IN SO FAR AS IT IS REGARDED AS BEING WITHOUT THE IDEA
5456-24741-0014.flac,WHICH ASSOCIATION ARISES IN THE MIND ACCORDING TO THE ORDER AND ASSOCIATION OF THE MODIFICATIONS AFFECTIONES OF THE HUMAN BODY I SAY FIRST IT IS AN ASSOCIATION OF THOSE IDEAS ONLY
5456-24741-0015.flac,IDEAS OF THE MODIFICATIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY ARE STRICTLY SPEAKING
5456-24741-0016.flac,THOSE WHICH INVOLVE THE NATURE BOTH OF THE HUMAN BODY AND OF EXTERNAL BODIES I SAY SECONDLY
5456-24741-0017.flac,IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM THAT ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS
5456-24741-0018.flac,WHEREBY THE MIND PERCEIVES THINGS THROUGH THEIR PRIMARY CAUSES
5456-24741-0019.flac,AND HENCE WE CAN FURTHER CLEARLY UNDERSTAND WHY THE MIND FROM THE THOUGHT OF ONE THING SHOULD STRAIGHTWAY ARRIVE AT THE THOUGHT OF ANOTHER THING WHICH HAS NO SIMILARITY WITH THE FIRST FOR INSTANCE FROM THE THOUGHT OF THE WORD POMUM AN APPLE
5456-24741-0020.flac,A ROMAN WOULD STRAIGHTWAY ARRIVE AT THE THOUGHT OF THE FRUIT APPLE WHICH HAS NO SIMILITUDE WITH THE ARTICULATE SOUND IN QUESTION NOR ANYTHING IN COMMON WITH IT
5456-24741-0021.flac,THAT IS THAT THE MAN HAS OFTEN HEARD THE WORD POMUM WHILE HE WAS LOOKING AT THE FRUIT
5456-24741-0022.flac,OR THE HUMAN MIND PERCEIVES THOSE MODIFICATIONS
5456-24741-0023.flac,THE HUMAN BODY ITSELF AND AS ACTUALLY EXISTING THEREFORE THE MIND PERCEIVES THUS FAR ONLY THE HUMAN BODY
5456-24741-0024.flac,FOLLOWING IN GOD IN THE SAME MANNER AND BEING REFERRED TO GOD IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE IDEA OR KNOWLEDGE OF THE HUMAN BODY PROOF
481-123720-0000.flac,ALL OF THEM TOOK SCARCELY ANY NOTICE OF MY ENTRANCE WHICH WAS STRANGE FOR I HAD NOT MET THEM FOR YEARS EVIDENTLY THEY LOOKED UPON ME AS SOMETHING ON THE LEVEL OF A COMMON FLY I HAD NOT BEEN TREATED LIKE THAT EVEN AT SCHOOL THOUGH THEY ALL HATED ME
481-123720-0001.flac,I KNEW OF COURSE THAT THEY MUST DESPISE ME NOW FOR MY LACK OF SUCCESS IN THE SERVICE AND FOR MY HAVING LET MYSELF SINK SO LOW GOING ABOUT BADLY DRESSED AND SO ON WHICH SEEMED TO THEM A SIGN OF MY INCAPACITY AND INSIGNIFICANCE
481-123720-0002.flac,BUT I HAD NOT EXPECTED SUCH CONTEMPT SIMONOV WAS POSITIVELY SURPRISED AT MY TURNING UP
481-123720-0003.flac,ALL THIS DISCONCERTED ME I SAT DOWN FEELING RATHER MISERABLE AND BEGAN LISTENING TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE ENGAGED IN WARM AND EARNEST CONVERSATION ABOUT A FAREWELL DINNER WHICH THEY WANTED TO ARRANGE FOR THE NEXT DAY TO A COMRADE OF THEIRS CALLED ZVERKOV
481-123720-0004.flac,THIS ZVERKOV HAD BEEN ALL THE TIME AT SCHOOL WITH ME TOO I HAD BEGUN TO HATE HIM PARTICULARLY IN THE UPPER FORMS IN THE LOWER FORMS HE HAD SIMPLY BEEN A PRETTY PLAYFUL BOY WHOM EVERYBODY LIKED I HAD HATED HIM HOWEVER EVEN IN THE LOWER FORMS
481-123720-0005.flac,JUST BECAUSE HE WAS A PRETTY AND PLAYFUL BOY HE WAS ALWAYS BAD AT HIS LESSONS AND GOT WORSE AND WORSE AS HE WENT ON HOWEVER HE LEFT WITH A GOOD CERTIFICATE AS HE HAD POWERFUL INTERESTS DURING HIS LAST YEAR AT SCHOOL HE CAME IN FOR AN ESTATE OF TWO HUNDRED SERFS
481-123720-0006.flac,AND AS ALMOST ALL OF US WERE POOR HE TOOK UP A SWAGGERING TONE AMONG US HE WAS VULGAR IN THE EXTREME BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS A GOOD NATURED FELLOW EVEN IN HIS SWAGGERING
481-123720-0007.flac,IN SPITE OF SUPERFICIAL FANTASTIC AND SHAM NOTIONS OF HONOUR AND DIGNITY ALL BUT VERY FEW OF US POSITIVELY GROVELLED BEFORE ZVERKOV AND THE MORE SO THE MORE HE SWAGGERED AND IT WAS NOT FROM ANY INTERESTED MOTIVE
481-123720-0008.flac,BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN FAVOURED BY THE GIFTS OF NATURE MOREOVER IT WAS AS IT WERE AN ACCEPTED IDEA AMONG US THAT ZVERKOV WAS A SPECIALIST IN REGARD TO TACT AND THE SOCIAL GRACES THIS LAST FACT PARTICULARLY INFURIATED ME
481-123720-0009.flac,I HATED THE ABRUPT SELF CONFIDENT TONE OF HIS VOICE HIS ADMIRATION OF HIS OWN WITTICISMS
481-123720-0010.flac,THOUGH HE WAS BOLD IN HIS LANGUAGE I HATED HIS HANDSOME BUT STUPID FACE FOR WHICH I WOULD HOWEVER HAVE GLADLY EXCHANGED MY INTELLIGENT ONE AND THE FREE AND EASY MILITARY MANNERS IN FASHION IN THE FORTIES
481-123720-0011.flac,I HATED THE WAY IN WHICH HE USED TO TALK OF HIS FUTURE CONQUESTS OF WOMEN HE DID NOT VENTURE TO BEGIN HIS ATTACK UPON WOMEN UNTIL HE HAD THE EPAULETTES OF AN OFFICER AND WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM WITH IMPATIENCE AND BOASTED OF THE DUELS HE WOULD CONSTANTLY BE FIGHTING
481-123720-0012.flac,I REMEMBER HOW I INVARIABLY SO TACITURN SUDDENLY FASTENED UPON ZVERKOV WHEN ONE DAY TALKING AT A LEISURE MOMENT WITH HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS OF HIS FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE FAIR SEX AND GROWING AS SPORTIVE AS A PUPPY IN THE SUN
481-123720-0013.flac,HE ALL AT ONCE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NOT LEAVE A SINGLE VILLAGE GIRL ON HIS ESTATE UNNOTICED
481-123720-0014.flac,AND THAT IF THE PEASANTS DARED TO PROTEST HE WOULD HAVE THEM ALL FLOGGED AND DOUBLE THE TAX ON THEM THE BEARDED RASCALS OUR SERVILE RABBLE APPLAUDED BUT I ATTACKED HIM NOT FROM COMPASSION FOR THE GIRLS AND THEIR FATHERS
481-123720-0015.flac,BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE APPLAUDING SUCH AN INSECT I GOT THE BETTER OF HIM ON THAT OCCASION BUT THOUGH ZVERKOV WAS STUPID HE WAS LIVELY AND IMPUDENT AND SO LAUGHED IT OFF AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT MY VICTORY WAS NOT REALLY COMPLETE
481-123720-0016.flac,THE LAUGH WAS ON HIS SIDE HE GOT THE BETTER OF ME ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AFTERWARDS BUT WITHOUT MALICE JESTINGLY CASUALLY I REMAINED ANGRILY AND CONTEMPTUOUSLY SILENT AND WOULD NOT ANSWER HIM WHEN WE LEFT SCHOOL HE MADE ADVANCES TO ME
481-123720-0017.flac,I DID NOT REBUFF THEM FOR I WAS FLATTERED BUT WE SOON PARTED AND QUITE NATURALLY AFTERWARDS I HEARD OF HIS BARRACK ROOM SUCCESS AS A LIEUTENANT AND OF THE FAST LIFE HE WAS LEADING THEN THERE CAME OTHER RUMOURS
481-123720-0018.flac,BY THEN HE HAD TAKEN TO CUTTING ME IN THE STREET AND I SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF COMPROMISING HIMSELF BY GREETING A PERSONAGE AS INSIGNIFICANT AS ME I SAW HIM ONCE IN THE THEATRE IN THE THIRD TIER OF BOXES
481-123720-0019.flac,BY THEN HE WAS WEARING SHOULDER STRAPS HE WAS TWISTING AND TWIRLING ABOUT INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF AN ANCIENT GENERAL IN THREE YEARS HE HAD GONE OFF CONSIDERABLY THOUGH HE WAS STILL RATHER HANDSOME AND ADROIT
481-123720-0020.flac,ONE COULD SEE THAT BY THE TIME HE WAS THIRTY HE WOULD BE CORPULENT
481-123720-0021.flac,THEY HAD KEPT UP WITH HIM FOR THOSE THREE YEARS THOUGH PRIVATELY THEY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH HIM I AM CONVINCED OF THAT OF SIMONOV'S TWO VISITORS ONE WAS FERFITCHKIN A RUSSIANISED GERMAN
481-123720-0022.flac,A LITTLE FELLOW WITH THE FACE OF A MONKEY A BLOCKHEAD WHO WAS ALWAYS DERIDING EVERYONE A VERY BITTER ENEMY OF MINE FROM OUR DAYS IN THE LOWER FORMS A VULGAR IMPUDENT SWAGGERING FELLOW WHO AFFECTED A MOST SENSITIVE FEELING
481-123720-0023.flac,OF PERSONAL HONOUR THOUGH OF COURSE HE WAS A WRETCHED LITTLE COWARD AT HEART HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WORSHIPPERS OF ZVERKOV WHO MADE UP TO THE LATTER FROM INTERESTED MOTIVES AND OFTEN BORROWED MONEY FROM HIM SIMONOV'S OTHER VISITOR TRUDOLYUBOV WAS A PERSON IN NO WAY REMARKABLE
481-123720-0024.flac,A TALL YOUNG FELLOW IN THE ARMY WITH A COLD FACE FAIRLY HONEST THOUGH HE WORSHIPPED SUCCESS OF EVERY SORT AND WAS ONLY CAPABLE OF THINKING OF PROMOTION HE WAS SOME SORT OF DISTANT RELATION OF ZVERKOV'S AND THIS
481-123720-0025.flac,GAVE HIM A CERTAIN IMPORTANCE AMONG US HE ALWAYS THOUGHT ME OF NO CONSEQUENCE WHATEVER HIS BEHAVIOUR TO ME THOUGH NOT QUITE COURTEOUS WAS TOLERABLE WELL WITH SEVEN ROUBLES EACH SAID TRUDOLYUBOV TWENTY ONE ROUBLES BETWEEN THE THREE OF US
481-123720-0026.flac,WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET A GOOD DINNER ZVERKOV OF COURSE WON'T PAY OF COURSE NOT SINCE WE ARE INVITING HIM SIMONOV DECIDED CAN YOU IMAGINE FERFITCHKIN INTERRUPTED HOTLY AND CONCEITEDLY
481-123720-0027.flac,LIKE SOME INSOLENT FLUNKEY BOASTING OF HIS MASTER THE GENERAL'S DECORATIONS CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT ZVERKOV WILL LET US PAY ALONE HE WILL ACCEPT FROM DELICACY
481-123720-0028.flac,SO THE THREE OF US WITH ZVERKOV FOR THE FOURTH
481-123720-0029.flac,SIMONOV WHO HAD BEEN ASKED TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS CONCLUDED FINALLY HOW TWENTY ONE ROUBLES I ASKED IN SOME AGITATION WITH A SHOW OF BEING OFFENDED
481-123720-0030.flac,TWENTY EIGHT ROUBLES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT TO INVITE MYSELF SO SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY WOULD BE POSITIVELY GRACEFUL AND THAT THEY WOULD ALL BE CONQUERED AT ONCE
481-123720-0031.flac,DO YOU WANT TO JOIN TOO SIMONOV OBSERVED WITH NO APPEARANCE OF PLEASURE SEEMING TO AVOID LOOKING AT ME HE KNEW ME THROUGH AND THROUGH IT INFURIATED ME THAT HE KNEW ME SO THOROUGHLY WHY NOT
481-123720-0032.flac,I AM AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW OF HIS TOO I BELIEVE AND I MUST OWN I FEEL HURT THAT YOU HAVE LEFT ME OUT I SAID BOILING OVER AGAIN AND WHERE WERE WE TO FIND YOU FERFITCHKIN PUT IN ROUGHLY YOU NEVER WERE ON GOOD TERMS WITH ZVERKOV TRUDOLYUBOV ADDED FROWNING
481-123720-0033.flac,BUT I HAD ALREADY CLUTCHED AT THE IDEA AND WOULD NOT GIVE IT UP IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO FORM AN OPINION UPON THAT I RETORTED IN A SHAKING VOICE AS THOUGH SOMETHING TREMENDOUS HAD HAPPENED PERHAPS THAT IS JUST MY REASON FOR WISHING IT NOW
481-123720-0034.flac,THAT I HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIM OH THERE'S NO MAKING YOU OUT WITH THESE REFINEMENTS TRUDOLYUBOV JEERED WE'LL PUT YOUR NAME DOWN SIMONOV DECIDED ADDRESSING ME
481-123720-0035.flac,WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY FERFITCHKIN BEGAN IN AN UNDERTONE INDICATING ME TO SIMONOV BUT HE BROKE OFF FOR EVEN SIMONOV WAS EMBARRASSED THAT WILL DO SAID TRUDOLYUBOV GETTING UP IF HE WANTS TO COME SO MUCH LET HIM
481-123720-0036.flac,BUT IT'S A PRIVATE THING BETWEEN US FRIENDS FERFITCHKIN SAID CROSSLY AS HE TOO PICKED UP HIS HAT IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL GATHERING WE DO NOT WANT AT ALL PERHAPS THEY WENT AWAY FERFITCHKIN DID NOT GREET ME IN ANY WAY AS HE WENT OUT
481-123720-0037.flac,TRUDOLYUBOV BARELY NODDED SIMONOV WITH WHOM I WAS LEFT TETE A TETE WAS IN A STATE OF VEXATION AND PERPLEXITY AND LOOKED AT ME QUEERLY
481-123720-0038.flac,WILL YOU PAY YOUR SUBSCRIPTION NOW I JUST ASK SO AS TO KNOW HE MUTTERED IN EMBARRASSMENT I FLUSHED CRIMSON AS I DID SO I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD OWED SIMONOV FIFTEEN ROUBLES FOR AGES
481-123720-0039.flac,WHICH I HAD INDEED NEVER FORGOTTEN THOUGH I HAD NOT PAID IT
481-123720-0040.flac,VEXED THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT THAT DOESN'T MATTER YOU CAN PAY TOMORROW AFTER THE DINNER I SIMPLY WANTED TO KNOW PLEASE DON'T HE BROKE OFF AND BEGAN PACING THE ROOM STILL MORE VEXED AS HE WALKED HE BEGAN TO STAMP WITH HIS HEELS
481-123720-0041.flac,AM I KEEPING YOU I ASKED AFTER TWO MINUTES OF SILENCE
481-123720-0042.flac,THAT IS TO BE TRUTHFUL YES I HAVE TO GO AND SEE SOMEONE NOT FAR FROM HERE
481-123720-0043.flac,MY GOODNESS WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO I CRIED
481-123720-0044.flac,IT'S CLOSE BY NOT TWO PACES AWAY SIMONOV REPEATED ACCOMPANYING ME TO THE FRONT DOOR WITH A FUSSY AIR WHICH DID NOT SUIT HIM AT ALL
481-123720-0045.flac,HE WAS VERY GLAD TO GET RID OF ME I WAS IN A FURY WHAT POSSESSED ME WHAT POSSESSED ME TO FORCE MYSELF UPON THEM I WONDERED GRINDING MY TEETH AS I STRODE ALONG THE STREET FOR A SCOUNDREL A PIG LIKE THAT ZVERKOV OF COURSE
481-123720-0046.flac,I HAD BETTER NOT GO OF COURSE I MUST JUST SNAP MY FINGERS AT THEM
481-123720-0047.flac,BUT WHAT MADE ME FURIOUS WAS THAT I KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT I SHOULD GO THAT I SHOULD MAKE A POINT OF GOING AND THE MORE TACTLESS THE MORE UNSEEMLY MY GOING WOULD BE THE MORE CERTAINLY I WOULD GO AND THERE WAS A POSITIVE OBSTACLE TO MY GOING
481-123720-0048.flac,I HAD NO MONEY ALL I HAD WAS NINE ROUBLES I HAD TO GIVE SEVEN OF THAT TO MY SERVANT APOLLON FOR HIS MONTHLY WAGES THAT WAS ALL I PAID HIM HE HAD TO KEEP HIMSELF
481-123720-0049.flac,NOT TO PAY HIM WAS IMPOSSIBLE CONSIDERING HIS CHARACTER BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT THAT FELLOW ABOUT THAT PLAGUE OF MINE ANOTHER TIME HOWEVER I KNEW I SHOULD GO AND SHOULD NOT PAY HIM HIS WAGES THAT NIGHT I HAD THE MOST HIDEOUS DREAMS
481-123720-0050.flac,I WAS SENT TO THE SCHOOL BY DISTANT RELATIONS UPON WHOM I WAS DEPENDENT AND OF WHOM I HAVE HEARD NOTHING SINCE THEY SENT ME THERE A FORLORN SILENT BOY ALREADY CRUSHED BY THEIR REPROACHES ALREADY TROUBLED BY DOUBT
481-123720-0051.flac,AND LOOKING WITH SAVAGE DISTRUST AT EVERYONE MY SCHOOLFELLOWS MET ME WITH SPITEFUL AND MERCILESS JIBES BECAUSE I WAS NOT LIKE ANY OF THEM BUT I COULD NOT ENDURE THEIR TAUNTS
481-123720-0052.flac,I COULD NOT GIVE IN TO THEM WITH THE IGNOBLE READINESS WITH WHICH THEY GAVE IN TO ONE ANOTHER I HATED THEM FROM THE FIRST AND SHUT MYSELF AWAY FROM EVERYONE IN TIMID WOUNDED AND DISPROPORTIONATE PRIDE
481-123720-0053.flac,THEIR COARSENESS REVOLTED ME THEY LAUGHED CYNICALLY AT MY FACE AT MY CLUMSY FIGURE AND YET WHAT STUPID FACES THEY HAD THEMSELVES IN OUR SCHOOL THE BOYS FACES SEEMED IN A SPECIAL WAY TO DEGENERATE AND GROW STUPIDER
481-123720-0054.flac,HOW MANY FINE LOOKING BOYS CAME TO US IN A FEW YEARS THEY BECAME REPULSIVE EVEN AT SIXTEEN I WONDERED AT THEM MOROSELY EVEN THEN I WAS STRUCK BY THE PETTINESS OF THEIR THOUGHTS THE STUPIDITY OF THEIR PURSUITS
481-123720-0055.flac,THEIR GAMES THEIR CONVERSATIONS THEY HAD NO UNDERSTANDING OF SUCH ESSENTIAL THINGS THEY TOOK NO INTEREST IN SUCH STRIKING IMPRESSIVE SUBJECTS THAT I COULD NOT HELP CONSIDERING THEM INFERIOR TO MYSELF
481-123720-0056.flac,IT WAS NOT WOUNDED VANITY THAT DROVE ME TO IT AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT THRUST UPON ME YOUR HACKNEYED REMARKS REPEATED TO NAUSEA THAT I WAS ONLY A DREAMER WHILE THEY EVEN THEN HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE
481-123720-0057.flac,THEY TOOK RANK FOR INTELLIGENCE EVEN AT SIXTEEN THEY WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT A SNUG BERTH OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF IT WAS DUE TO THEIR STUPIDITY TO THE BAD EXAMPLES WITH WHICH THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN SURROUNDED IN THEIR CHILDHOOD AND BOYHOOD
481-123720-0058.flac,THEY WERE MONSTROUSLY DEPRAVED OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF THAT TOO WAS SUPERFICIAL AND AN ASSUMPTION OF CYNICISM OF COURSE THERE WERE GLIMPSES OF YOUTH AND FRESHNESS EVEN IN THEIR DEPRAVITY BUT EVEN THAT FRESHNESS WAS NOT ATTRACTIVE
481-123720-0059.flac,AND SHOWED ITSELF IN A CERTAIN RAKISHNESS I HATED THEM HORRIBLY THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM THEY REPAID ME IN THE SAME WAY AND DID NOT CONCEAL THEIR AVERSION FOR ME BUT BY THEN I DID NOT DESIRE THEIR AFFECTION
481-123720-0060.flac,ON THE CONTRARY I CONTINUALLY LONGED FOR THEIR HUMILIATION TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR DERISION I PURPOSELY BEGAN TO MAKE ALL THE PROGRESS I COULD WITH MY STUDIES AND FORCED MY WAY TO THE VERY TOP THIS IMPRESSED THEM
481-123720-0061.flac,MOREOVER THEY ALL BEGAN BY DEGREES TO GRASP THAT I HAD ALREADY READ BOOKS NONE OF THEM COULD READ AND UNDERSTOOD THINGS NOT FORMING PART OF OUR SCHOOL CURRICULUM OF WHICH THEY HAD NOT EVEN HEARD THEY TOOK A SAVAGE AND SARCASTIC VIEW OF IT
481-123720-0062.flac,BUT WERE MORALLY IMPRESSED ESPECIALLY AS THE TEACHERS BEGAN TO NOTICE ME ON THOSE GROUNDS THE MOCKERY CEASED BUT THE HOSTILITY REMAINED AND COLD AND STRAINED RELATIONS BECAME PERMANENT BETWEEN US IN THE END I COULD NOT PUT UP WITH IT
481-123720-0063.flac,WITH YEARS A CRAVING FOR SOCIETY FOR FRIENDS DEVELOPED IN ME I ATTEMPTED TO GET ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH SOME OF MY SCHOOLFELLOWS BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER MY INTIMACY WITH THEM WAS ALWAYS STRAINED AND SOON ENDED OF ITSELF
481-123720-0064.flac,ONCE INDEED I DID HAVE A FRIEND
481-123720-0065.flac,AND REPULSED HIM AS THOUGH ALL I NEEDED HIM FOR WAS TO WIN A VICTORY OVER HIM TO SUBJUGATE HIM AND NOTHING ELSE BUT I COULD NOT SUBJUGATE ALL OF THEM MY FRIEND WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE THEM EITHER HE WAS IN FACT A RARE EXCEPTION
481-123720-0066.flac,THE FIRST THING I DID ON LEAVING SCHOOL WAS TO GIVE UP THE SPECIAL JOB FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN DESTINED SO AS TO BREAK ALL TIES
481-123720-0067.flac,AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHY AFTER ALL THAT I SHOULD GO TRUDGING OFF TO SIMONOV'S EARLY NEXT MORNING I ROUSED MYSELF AND JUMPED OUT OF BED WITH EXCITEMENT AS THOUGH IT WERE ALL ABOUT TO HAPPEN AT ONCE
481-123720-0068.flac,BUT I BELIEVED THAT SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WAS COMING AND WOULD INEVITABLY COME THAT DAY OWING TO ITS RARITY PERHAPS ANY EXTERNAL EVENT HOWEVER TRIVIAL ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WERE AT HAND
481-123720-0069.flac,I WENT TO THE OFFICE HOWEVER AS USUAL BUT SNEAKED AWAY HOME TWO HOURS EARLIER TO GET READY THE GREAT THING I THOUGHT IS NOT TO BE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE OR THEY WILL THINK I AM OVERJOYED AT COMING BUT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF SUCH
481-123720-0070.flac,AND THEY ALL AGITATED AND OVERWHELMED ME I POLISHED MY BOOTS A SECOND TIME WITH MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD HAVE INDUCED APOLLON TO CLEAN THEM TWICE A DAY AS HE CONSIDERED THAT IT WAS MORE THAN HIS DUTIES REQUIRED OF HIM
481-123720-0071.flac,I STOLE THE BRUSHES TO CLEAN THEM FROM THE PASSAGE BEING CAREFUL HE SHOULD NOT DETECT IT FOR FEAR OF HIS CONTEMPT
481-123720-0072.flac,I HAD LET MYSELF GET TOO SLOVENLY MY UNIFORM PERHAPS WAS TIDY BUT I COULD NOT GO OUT TO DINNER IN MY UNIFORM THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT ON THE KNEE OF MY TROUSERS WAS A BIG YELLOW STAIN
481-123720-0073.flac,I HAD A FOREBODING THAT THAT STAIN WOULD DEPRIVE ME OF NINE TENTHS OF MY PERSONAL DIGNITY I KNEW TOO THAT IT WAS VERY POOR TO THINK SO BUT THIS IS NO TIME FOR THINKING NOW I AM IN FOR THE REAL THING I THOUGHT AND MY HEART SANK
481-123720-0074.flac,I KNEW TOO PERFECTLY WELL EVEN THEN THAT I WAS MONSTROUSLY EXAGGERATING THE FACTS BUT HOW COULD I HELP IT
481-123720-0075.flac,WITH DESPAIR I PICTURED TO MYSELF HOW COLDLY AND DISDAINFULLY THAT SCOUNDREL ZVERKOV WOULD MEET ME
481-123720-0076.flac,WITH WHAT IMPUDENT RUDENESS THE INSECT FERFITCHKIN WOULD SNIGGER AT ME IN ORDER TO CURRY FAVOUR WITH ZVERKOV HOW COMPLETELY SIMONOV WOULD TAKE IT ALL IN AND HOW HE WOULD DESPISE ME FOR THE ABJECTNESS OF MY VANITY AND LACK OF SPIRIT
481-123720-0077.flac,AND WORST OF ALL HOW PALTRY UNLITERARY COMMONPLACE IT WOULD ALL BE
481-123720-0078.flac,BUT THAT WAS MOST IMPOSSIBLE OF ALL IF I FEEL IMPELLED TO DO ANYTHING I SEEM TO BE PITCHFORKED INTO IT I SHOULD HAVE JEERED AT MYSELF EVER AFTERWARDS SO YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED THE REAL THING
481-123720-0079.flac,ON THE CONTRARY I PASSIONATELY LONGED TO SHOW ALL THAT RABBLE THAT I WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A SPIRITLESS CREATURE AS I SEEMED TO MYSELF WHAT IS MORE EVEN IN THE ACUTEST PAROXYSM OF THIS COWARDLY FEVER I DREAMED OF GETTING THE UPPER HAND
481-123720-0080.flac,OF DOMINATING THEM CARRYING THEM AWAY MAKING THEM LIKE ME IF ONLY FOR MY ELEVATION OF THOUGHT AND UNMISTAKABLE WIT THEY WOULD ABANDON ZVERKOV HE WOULD SIT ON ONE SIDE SILENT AND ASHAMED WHILE I SHOULD CRUSH HIM THEN PERHAPS
481-123720-0081.flac,WE WOULD BE RECONCILED AND DRINK TO OUR EVERLASTING FRIENDSHIP BUT WHAT WAS MOST BITTER AND HUMILIATING FOR ME WAS THAT I KNEW EVEN THEN KNEW FULLY AND FOR CERTAIN THAT I NEEDED NOTHING OF ALL THIS REALLY THAT I DID NOT REALLY WANT TO CRUSH
481-123720-0082.flac,TO SUBDUE TO ATTRACT THEM
481-123720-0083.flac,OH HOW I PRAYED FOR THE DAY TO PASS QUICKLY
481-123720-0084.flac,OPENED THE MOVABLE PANE AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE TROUBLED DARKNESS OF THE THICKLY FALLING WET SNOW AT LAST MY WRETCHED LITTLE CLOCK HISSED OUT FIVE I SEIZED MY HAT AND TRYING NOT TO LOOK AT APOLLON
481-123720-0085.flac,WHO HAD BEEN ALL DAY EXPECTING HIS MONTH'S WAGES BUT IN HIS FOOLISHNESS WAS UNWILLING TO BE THE FIRST TO SPEAK ABOUT IT I SLIPPED BETWEEN HIM AND THE DOOR AND JUMPING INTO A HIGH CLASS SLEDGE ON WHICH I SPENT MY LAST HALF ROUBLE
481-123719-0000.flac,IT WAS FOLLOWED BY REMORSE I TRIED TO DRIVE IT AWAY I FELT TOO SICK
481-123719-0001.flac,I GREW USED TO EVERYTHING OR RATHER I VOLUNTARILY RESIGNED MYSELF TO ENDURING IT BUT I HAD A MEANS OF ESCAPE THAT RECONCILED EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO FIND REFUGE IN THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL IN DREAMS OF COURSE
481-123719-0002.flac,I WAS A TERRIBLE DREAMER I WOULD DREAM FOR THREE MONTHS ON END TUCKED AWAY IN MY CORNER AND YOU MAY BELIEVE ME THAT AT THOSE MOMENTS I HAD NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IN THE PERTURBATION OF HIS CHICKEN HEART
481-123719-0003.flac,PUT A COLLAR OF GERMAN BEAVER ON HIS GREAT COAT I SUDDENLY BECAME A HERO I WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED MY SIX FOOT LIEUTENANT EVEN IF HE HAD CALLED ON ME
481-123719-0004.flac,BEFORE ME THEN WHAT WERE MY DREAMS
481-123719-0005.flac,THOUGH INDEED EVEN NOW I AM TO SOME EXTENT SATISFIED WITH THEM DREAMS WERE PARTICULARLY SWEET AND VIVID AFTER A SPELL OF DISSIPATION
481-123719-0006.flac,THERE WERE MOMENTS OF SUCH POSITIVE INTOXICATION OF SUCH HAPPINESS THAT THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST TRACE OF IRONY WITHIN ME ON MY HONOUR I HAD FAITH HOPE LOVE I BELIEVED BLINDLY AT SUCH TIMES THAT BY SOME MIRACLE
481-123719-0007.flac,BY SOME EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCE ALL THIS WOULD SUDDENLY OPEN OUT EXPAND THAT SUDDENLY A VISTA OF SUITABLE ACTIVITY BENEFICENT GOOD AND ABOVE ALL READY MADE WHAT SORT OF ACTIVITY I HAD NO IDEA
481-123719-0008.flac,BUT THE GREAT THING WAS THAT IT SHOULD BE ALL READY FOR ME WOULD RISE UP BEFORE ME AND I SHOULD COME OUT INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY ALMOST RIDING A WHITE HORSE AND CROWNED WITH LAUREL ANYTHING BUT THE FOREMOST PLACE I COULD NOT CONCEIVE FOR MYSELF
481-123719-0009.flac,AND FOR THAT VERY REASON I QUITE CONTENTEDLY OCCUPIED THE LOWEST IN REALITY EITHER TO BE A HERO OR TO GROVEL IN THE MUD THERE WAS NOTHING BETWEEN
481-123719-0010.flac,THAT WAS MY RUIN FOR WHEN I WAS IN THE MUD I COMFORTED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT AT OTHER TIMES I WAS A HERO AND THE HERO WAS A CLOAK FOR THE MUD
481-123719-0011.flac,IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THESE ATTACKS OF THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL VISITED ME EVEN DURING THE PERIOD OF DISSIPATION AND JUST AT THE TIMES WHEN I WAS TOUCHING THE BOTTOM THEY CAME IN SEPARATE SPURTS AS THOUGH REMINDING ME OF THEMSELVES
481-123719-0012.flac,BUT DID NOT BANISH THE DISSIPATION BY THEIR APPEARANCE ON THE CONTRARY
481-123719-0013.flac,AND WERE ONLY SUFFICIENTLY PRESENT TO SERVE AS AN APPETISING SAUCE THAT SAUCE WAS MADE UP OF CONTRADICTIONS AND SUFFERINGS OF AGONISING INWARD ANALYSIS AND ALL THESE PANGS AND PIN PRICKS GAVE A CERTAIN PIQUANCY
481-123719-0014.flac,EVEN A SIGNIFICANCE TO MY DISSIPATION IN FACT COMPLETELY ANSWERED THE PURPOSE OF AN APPETISING SAUCE THERE WAS A CERTAIN DEPTH OF MEANING IN IT AND I COULD HARDLY HAVE RESIGNED MYSELF TO THE SIMPLE VULGAR DIRECT DEBAUCHERY OF A CLERK
481-123719-0015.flac,AND HAVE ENDURED ALL THE FILTHINESS OF IT
481-123719-0016.flac,INTO THE STREET NO I HAD A LOFTY WAY OF GETTING OUT OF IT ALL
481-123719-0017.flac,IN THOSE FLIGHTS INTO THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL THOUGH IT WAS FANTASTIC LOVE THOUGH IT WAS NEVER APPLIED TO ANYTHING HUMAN IN REALITY YET THERE WAS SO MUCH OF THIS LOVE THAT ONE DID NOT FEEL AFTERWARDS EVEN THE IMPULSE TO APPLY IT IN REALITY
481-123719-0018.flac,EVERYTHING HOWEVER PASSED SATISFACTORILY BY A LAZY AND FASCINATING TRANSITION INTO THE SPHERE OF ART THAT IS INTO THE BEAUTIFUL FORMS OF LIFE LYING READY
481-123719-0019.flac,I CAME IN FOR COUNTLESS MILLIONS AND IMMEDIATELY DEVOTED THEM TO HUMANITY AND AT THE SAME TIME I CONFESSED BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE MY SHAMEFUL DEEDS WHICH OF COURSE WERE NOT MERELY SHAMEFUL BUT HAD IN THEM
481-123719-0020.flac,MUCH THAT WAS SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL SOMETHING IN THE MANFRED STYLE EVERYONE WOULD KISS ME AND WEEP
481-123719-0021.flac,AUSTERLITZ AGAINST THE OBSCURANTISTS THEN THE BAND WOULD PLAY A MARCH AN AMNESTY WOULD BE DECLARED THE POPE WOULD AGREE TO RETIRE FROM ROME TO BRAZIL
481-123719-0022.flac,LAKE COMO BEING FOR THAT PURPOSE TRANSFERRED TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF ROME THEN WOULD COME A SCENE IN THE BUSHES AND SO ON AND SO ON AS THOUGH YOU DID NOT KNOW ALL ABOUT IT YOU WILL SAY THAT IT IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE TO DRAG ALL THIS INTO PUBLIC
481-123719-0023.flac,BUT WHY IS IT CONTEMPTIBLE CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT I AM ASHAMED OF IT ALL AND THAT IT WAS STUPIDER THAN ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE GENTLEMEN AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT SOME OF THESE FANCIES WERE BY NO MEANS BADLY COMPOSED
481-123719-0024.flac,AND YET YOU ARE RIGHT IT REALLY IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE
481-123719-0025.flac,AND EVEN MORE CONTEMPTIBLE THAN THAT IS MY MAKING THIS REMARK NOW BUT THAT'S ENOUGH
481-123719-0026.flac,I COULD NEVER STAND MORE THAN THREE MONTHS OF DREAMING AT A TIME WITHOUT FEELING AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE TO PLUNGE INTO SOCIETY TO PLUNGE INTO SOCIETY MEANT
481-123719-0027.flac,TO VISIT MY SUPERIOR AT THE OFFICE ANTON ANTONITCH SYETOTCHKIN HE WAS THE ONLY PERMANENT ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE
481-123719-0028.flac,THAT IT BECAME ESSENTIAL AT ONCE TO EMBRACE MY FELLOWS AND ALL MANKIND AND FOR THAT PURPOSE I NEEDED AT LEAST ONE HUMAN BEING ACTUALLY EXISTING I HAD TO CALL ON ANTON ANTONITCH HOWEVER ON TUESDAY
481-123719-0029.flac,HIS AT HOME DAY SO I HAD ALWAYS TO TIME MY PASSIONATE DESIRE TO EMBRACE HUMANITY SO THAT IT MIGHT FALL ON A TUESDAY THIS ANTON ANTONITCH LIVED ON THE FOURTH STOREY IN A HOUSE IN FIVE CORNERS IN FOUR LOW PITCHED ROOMS
481-123719-0030.flac,ONE SMALLER THAN THE OTHER OF A PARTICULARLY FRUGAL AND SALLOW APPEARANCE HE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS AND THEIR AUNT WHO USED TO POUR OUT THE TEA OF THE DAUGHTERS ONE WAS THIRTEEN AND ANOTHER FOURTEEN
481-123719-0031.flac,THEY BOTH HAD SNUB NOSES AND I WAS AWFULLY SHY OF THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE ALWAYS WHISPERING AND GIGGLING TOGETHER THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE USUALLY SAT IN HIS STUDY ON A LEATHER COUCH IN FRONT OF THE TABLE WITH SOME GREY HEADED GENTLEMAN
481-123719-0032.flac,USUALLY A COLLEAGUE FROM OUR OFFICE OR SOME OTHER DEPARTMENT I NEVER SAW MORE THAN TWO OR THREE VISITORS THERE ALWAYS THE SAME THEY TALKED ABOUT THE EXCISE DUTY
481-123719-0033.flac,AND THE BEST MEANS OF PLEASING HIM AND SO ON I HAD THE PATIENCE TO SIT LIKE A FOOL BESIDE THESE PEOPLE
481-123719-0034.flac,LISTENING TO THEM WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT TO SAY TO THEM OR VENTURING TO SAY A WORD I BECAME STUPEFIED SEVERAL TIMES I FELT MYSELF PERSPIRING I WAS OVERCOME BY A SORT OF PARALYSIS BUT THIS WAS PLEASANT AND GOOD FOR ME
481-123719-0035.flac,ON RETURNING HOME I DEFERRED FOR A TIME MY DESIRE TO EMBRACE ALL MANKIND I HAD HOWEVER ONE OTHER ACQUAINTANCE OF A SORT SIMONOV WHO WAS AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW I HAD A NUMBER OF SCHOOLFELLOWS INDEED IN PETERSBURG
481-123719-0036.flac,BUT I DID NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THEM AND HAD EVEN GIVEN UP NODDING TO THEM IN THE STREET I BELIEVE I HAD TRANSFERRED INTO THE DEPARTMENT I WAS IN SIMPLY TO AVOID THEIR COMPANY AND TO CUT OFF ALL CONNECTION WITH MY HATEFUL CHILDHOOD
481-123719-0037.flac,CURSES ON THAT SCHOOL AND ALL THOSE TERRIBLE YEARS OF PENAL SERVITUDE IN SHORT I PARTED FROM MY SCHOOLFELLOWS AS SOON AS I GOT OUT INTO THE WORLD THERE WERE TWO OR THREE LEFT TO WHOM I NODDED IN THE STREET ONE OF THEM WAS SIMONOV
481-123719-0038.flac,WHO HAD IN NO WAY BEEN DISTINGUISHED AT SCHOOL WAS OF A QUIET AND EQUABLE DISPOSITION BUT I DISCOVERED IN HIM A CERTAIN INDEPENDENCE OF CHARACTER AND EVEN HONESTY I DON'T EVEN SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS PARTICULARLY STUPID
481-123719-0039.flac,BUT THESE HAD NOT LASTED LONG AND HAD SOMEHOW BEEN SUDDENLY CLOUDED OVER HE WAS EVIDENTLY UNCOMFORTABLE AT THESE REMINISCENCES AND WAS I FANCY ALWAYS AFRAID THAT I MIGHT TAKE UP THE SAME TONE AGAIN
481-123719-0040.flac,NOT BEING QUITE CERTAIN OF IT
481-123719-0041.flac,BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENED THAT SUCH REFLECTIONS IMPELLED ME AS THOUGH PURPOSELY TO PUT MYSELF INTO A FALSE POSITION I WENT IN
7067-76047-0000.flac,AFTER TWENTY FOUR EVENTFUL HOURS OUR TWO STUDENTS OF HUMAN MOTIVES FOUND THEMSELVES TOGETHER AGAIN BY THE FIREPLACE IN THE OLD GEORGE SMOKING ROOM THEY HAD RESUMED THEIR OVERNIGHT CONVERSATION IN A STATE OF CONSIDERABLE TENSION
7067-76047-0001.flac,A BROAD AND ORIGINAL THINKER AS YOU ARE THOUGHT IS ONE MATTER RASH INCONSIDERATE ACTION QUITE ANOTHER AND ABOVE ALL IF I SPEND ANOTHER DAY IN OR NEAR THE COMPANY OF MISS
7067-76047-0002.flac,AND BIT HIS LOWER LIP AND CONSIDERED WE MIGHT DROP BELINDA HE SUGGESTED TURNING TO HIS FRIEND AND SPEAKING IN LOW CONFIDENTIAL TONES SHE IS QUITE A MANAGEABLE PERSON QUITE
7067-76047-0003.flac,SHE COULD FOR EXAMPLE BE LEFT BEHIND WITH THE LUGGAGE AND SENT ON BY TRAIN I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU REALIZE HOW THE LAND LIES IN THAT QUARTER IT NEEDS ONLY A WORD TO MISS GRAMMONT THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE REPLY
7067-76047-0004.flac,FOR A MOMENT HE HAD A WILD HOPE THAT HIS COMPANION WOULD AGREE AND THEN HE PERCEIVED THAT THE DOCTOR'S SILENCE MEANT ONLY THE PREPARATION OF AN ULTIMATUM I OBJECT TO MISS GRAMMONT AND THAT SIDE OF THE THING MORE THAN I DO TO MISS SEYFFERT
7067-76047-0005.flac,SIR RICHMOND SAID NOTHING IT MAY HELP YOU TO SEE THIS AFFAIR FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ANGLE IF I TELL YOU THAT TWICE TODAY MISS SEYFFERT HAS ASKED ME IF YOU WERE A MARRIED MAN AND OF COURSE YOU TOLD HER I WAS
7067-76047-0006.flac,ON THE SECOND OCCASION SIR RICHMOND SMILED AGAIN FRANKLY SAID THE DOCTOR THIS ADVENTURE IS ALTOGETHER UNCONGENIAL TO ME IT IS THE SORT OF THING THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED IN MY LIFE THIS HIGHWAY COUPLING
7067-76047-0007.flac,DON'T YOU THINK SAID SIR RICHMOND THAT YOU ARE ATTACHING RATHER TOO MUCH WHAT SHALL I SAY ROMANTIC FLIRTATIOUS MEANING TO THIS AFFAIR
7067-76047-0008.flac,BUT ISN'T YOUR ATTITUDE RATHER UNFAIR UNJUST INDEED AND ALMOST INSULTING TO THIS MISS GRAMMONT AFTER ALL SHE'S A YOUNG LADY OF VERY GOOD SOCIAL POSITION INDEED
7067-76047-0009.flac,SHE DOESN'T STRIKE YOU DOES SHE AS AN UNDIGNIFIED OR HELPLESS HUMAN BEING HER MANNERS SUGGEST A PERSON OF CONSIDERABLE SELF CONTROL AND KNOWING LESS OF ME THAN YOU DO SHE PROBABLY REGARDS ME AS ALMOST AS SAFE AS A MAIDEN AUNT SAY
7067-76047-0010.flac,I'M TWICE HER AGE WE ARE A PARTY OF FOUR THERE ARE CONVENTIONS THERE ARE CONSIDERATIONS AREN'T YOU REALLY MY DEAR MARTINEAU OVERDOING ALL THIS SIDE OF THIS VERY PLEASANT LITTLE ENLARGEMENT OF OUR INTERESTS
7067-76047-0011.flac,AM I SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND BROUGHT A SCRUTINIZING EYE TO BEAR ON SIR RICHMOND'S FACE I WANT TO GO ON TALKING TO MISS GRAMMONT FOR A DAY OR SO SIR RICHMOND ADMITTED THEN I SHALL PREFER TO LEAVE YOUR PARTY
7067-76047-0012.flac,THERE WERE SOME MOMENTS OF SILENCE I AM REALLY VERY SORRY TO FIND MYSELF IN THIS DILEMMA SAID SIR RICHMOND WITH A NOTE OF GENUINE REGRET IN HIS VOICE IT IS NOT A DILEMMA SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU WITH A CORRESPONDING LOSS OF ASPERITY
7067-76047-0013.flac,I GRANT YOU WE DISCOVER WE DIFFER UPON A QUESTION OF TASTE AND CONVENIENCE BUT BEFORE I SUGGESTED THIS TRIP I HAD INTENDED TO SPEND A LITTLE TIME WITH MY OLD FRIEND SIR KENELM LATTER AT BOURNEMOUTH NOTHING SIMPLER THAN TO GO TO HIM NOW
7067-76047-0014.flac,I SHALL BE SORRY ALL THE SAME I COULD HAVE WISHED SAID THE DOCTOR THAT THESE LADIES HAD HAPPENED A LITTLE LATER THE MATTER WAS SETTLED NOTHING MORE OF A PRACTICAL NATURE REMAINED TO BE SAID
7067-76047-0015.flac,BUT NEITHER GENTLEMAN WISHED TO BREAK OFF WITH A HARSH AND BARE DECISION WHEN THE NEW AGE IS HERE SAID SIR RICHMOND THEN SURELY A FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN WILL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO THE THE INCONVENIENCES YOUR PRESENT CODE WOULD SET ABOUT IT
7067-76047-0016.flac,AND HONOUR THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN BEFORE IN MATTERS OF PROPERTY ECONOMICS AND PUBLIC CONDUCT IT WILL PROBABLY BE JUST THE REVERSE THEN THERE WILL BE MUCH MORE COLLECTIVE CONTROL AND MUCH MORE INSISTENCE LEGAL INSISTENCE UPON INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY
7067-76047-0017.flac,BUT WE ARE NOT LIVING IN A NEW AGE YET WE ARE LIVING IN THE PATCHED UP RUINS OF A VERY OLD ONE AND YOU IF YOU WILL FORGIVE ME ARE LIVING IN THE PATCHED UP REMAINS OF A LIFE THAT HAD ALREADY HAD ITS COMPLICATIONS
7067-76047-0018.flac,THIS YOUNG LADY WHOSE CHARM AND CLEVERNESS I ADMIT BEHAVES AS IF THE NEW AGE WERE ALREADY HERE WELL THAT MAY BE A VERY DANGEROUS MISTAKE BOTH FOR HER AND FOR YOU THIS AFFAIR IF IT GOES ON FOR A FEW DAYS MORE
7067-76047-0019.flac,MAY INVOLVE VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES INDEED WITH WHICH I FOR ONE DO NOT WISH TO BE INVOLVED SIR RICHMOND UPON THE HEARTHRUG HAD A CURIOUS FEELING THAT HE WAS BACK IN THE HEAD MASTER'S STUDY AT CAXTON
7067-76047-0020.flac,AND IN MANY WAYS INTERESTING I HAVE BEEN WATCHING HER I HAVE NOT BEEN FAVOURED WITH VERY MUCH OF HER ATTENTION BUT THAT FACT HAS ENABLED ME TO SEE HER IN PROFILE
7067-76047-0021.flac,MISS SEYFFERT IS A FAIRLY CRUDE MIXTURE OF FRANKNESS INSINCERITY AND SELF EXPLANATORY EGOTISM AND I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISREGARD A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF THE CONVERSATION SHE HAS ADDRESSED TO ME
7067-76047-0022.flac,NOW I GUESS THIS MISS GRAMMONT HAS HAD NO MOTHER SINCE SHE WAS QUITE LITTLE YOUR GUESSES DOCTOR ARE APT TO BE PRETTY GOOD SAID SIR RICHMOND YOU KNOW THAT SHE HAS TOLD ME AS MUCH
7067-76047-0023.flac,WELL SHE IMPRESSED ME AS HAVING THE AIR OF A GIRL WHO HAS HAD TO SOLVE MANY PROBLEMS FOR WHICH THE NORMAL MOTHER PROVIDES READY MADE SOLUTIONS THAT IS HOW I INFERRED THAT THERE WAS NO MOTHER I DON'T THINK THERE HAS BEEN ANY STEPMOTHER
7067-76047-0024.flac,HER MANNER WITH MISS SEYFFERT AN EXCELLENT MANNER FOR MISS SEYFFERT BY THE BYE ISN'T THE SORT OF MANNER ANYONE ACQUIRES IN A DAY OR FOR ONE PERSON ONLY SHE IS A VERY SURE AND COMMANDING YOUNG WOMAN SIR RICHMOND NODDED
7067-76047-0025.flac,I SUPPOSE HER FATHER ADORES AND NEGLECTS HER AND WHENEVER SHE HAS WANTED A COMPANION OR GOVERNESS BUTCHERED THE THING HAS BEEN DONE THESE BUSINESS AMERICANS I AM TOLD NEGLECT THEIR WOMENKIND GIVE THEM MONEY AND POWER LET THEM LOOSE ON THE WORLD
7067-76047-0026.flac,IT IS A SORT OF MORAL LAZINESS MASQUERADING AS AFFECTION STILL I SUPPOSE CUSTOM AND TRADITION KEPT THIS GIRL IN HER PLACE AND SHE WAS PETTED HONOURED AMUSED
7067-76047-0027.flac,TALKED ABOUT BUT NOT IN A HARMFUL WAY AND RATHER BORED RIGHT UP TO THE TIME WHEN AMERICA CAME INTO THE WAR THEORETICALLY SHE HAD A TREMENDOUSLY GOOD TIME I THINK THIS MUST BE NEAR THE TRUTH OF HER BIOGRAPHY SAID SIR RICHMOND
7067-76047-0028.flac,I MEAN THAT SHE WAS SURROUNDED BY A RETINUE OF MEN WHO WANTED TO MARRY HER OR WHO BEHAVED AS THOUGH THEY WANTED TO MARRY HER OR WHO MADE HER HAPPINESS AND HER GRATIFICATIONS AND HER CONDESCENSIONS SEEM A MATTER OF VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THEM
7067-76047-0029.flac,SHE HAD THE FLATTERY OF AN EXTREMELY UNCRITICAL AND UNEXACTING ADMIRATION THAT IS THE SORT OF THING THAT GRATIFIES A SILLY WOMAN EXTREMELY MISS GRAMMONT IS NOT SILLY
7067-76047-0030.flac,PROBABLY BORED HER MORE THAN SHE REALIZED TO ANYONE TOO INTELLIGENT TO BE STEADILY EXCITED BY BUYING THINGS AND WEARING THINGS AND DANCING AND PLAYING GAMES AND GOING TO PLACES OF ENTERTAINMENT AND BEING GIVEN FLOWERS SWEETS JEWELLERY
7067-76047-0031.flac,AND THAT SHE HAD ALREADY READ AND THOUGHT RATHER MORE THAN MOST YOUNG WOMEN IN HER POSITION BEFORE SHE WAS TWENTY I GUESS SHE WAS ALREADY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING IN THE WAY OF MEN THAN A RICH ADMIRER WITH AN AUTOMOBILE FULL OF PRESENTS THOSE WHO SEEK FIND
7067-76047-0032.flac,WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE FOUND WHAT WOULD A RICH GIRL FIND OUT THERE IN AMERICA I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T THE MATERIAL TO GUESS WITH IN LONDON A GIRL MIGHT FIND A CONSIDERABLE VARIETY OF ACTIVE INTERESTING MEN RISING POLITICIANS UNIVERSITY MEN OF DISTINCTION
7067-76047-0033.flac,SHE WOULD FIND THAT LIFE WAS WORTH WHILE TO SUCH PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT MADE THE ORDINARY ENTERTAINMENTS AND AMUSEMENTS OF HER LIFE A MONSTROUS SILLY WASTE OF TIME WITH THE FACILITY OF HER SEX SHE WOULD PICK UP FROM ONE OF THEM THE IDEA THAT MADE LIFE WORTH WHILE FOR HIM
7067-76047-0034.flac,HARSH EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND VERY PROFOUND MENTAL DISTURBANCE THERE HAVE BEEN LOVE EXPERIENCES EXPERIENCES THAT WERE SOMETHING MORE THAN THE TREATS AND ATTENTIONS AND PROPOSALS THAT MADE UP HER LIFE WHEN SHE WAS SHELTERED OVER THERE
7067-76047-0035.flac,AND SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT WHAT IT IS I DON'T KNOW THE WAR HAS TURNED AN UGLY FACE TO HER SHE HAS SEEN DEATH AND SUFFERING AND RUIN PERHAPS SHE HAS SEEN PEOPLE SHE KNEW KILLED PERHAPS THE MAN HAS BEEN KILLED
7067-76047-0036.flac,OR SHE HAS MET WITH COWARDICE OR CRUELTY OR TREACHERY WHERE SHE DIDN'T EXPECT IT SHE HAS BEEN SHOCKED OUT OF THE FIRST CONFIDENCE OF YOUTH SHE HAS CEASED TO TAKE THE WORLD FOR GRANTED IT HASN'T BROKEN HER BUT IT HAS MATURED HER
7067-76047-0037.flac,THAT I THINK IS WHY HISTORY HAS BECOME REAL TO HER WHICH SO ATTRACTS YOU IN HER HISTORY FOR HER HAS CEASED TO BE A FABRIC OF PICTURESQUE INCIDENTS IT IS THE STUDY OF A TRAGIC STRUGGLE THAT STILL GOES ON
7067-76047-0038.flac,SHE SEES HISTORY AS YOU SEE IT AND I SEE IT SHE IS A VERY GROWN UP YOUNG WOMAN IT'S JUST THAT SAID SIR RICHMOND IT'S JUST THAT IF YOU SEE AS MUCH IN MISS GRAMMONT AS ALL THAT WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO COME ON WITH US YOU SEE THE INTEREST OF HER
7067-76047-0039.flac,I SEE A LOT MORE THAN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT AN ADVANTAGE IT IS TO BE AS I AM RATHER COLD AND UNRESPONSIVE TO WOMEN AND UNATTRACTIVE AND NEGLIGIBLE NEGLIGIBLE THAT IS THE EXACT WORD TO THEM YOU CAN'T LOOK AT A WOMAN FOR FIVE MINUTES
7067-76047-0040.flac,SEEMS TO IMPLY NECESSARILY A CERTAIN IMAGINATIVE FIXITY MISS GRAMMONT HAS AN IMPULSIVE AND ADVENTUROUS CHARACTER AND AS I HAVE BEEN SAYING SHE WAS A SPOILT CHILD WITH NO DISCIPLINE
7067-76047-0041.flac,YOU ALSO ARE A PERSON OF HIGH INTELLIGENCE AND DEFECTIVE CONTROLS SHE IS VERY MUCH AT LOOSE ENDS YOU ON ACCOUNT OF THE ILLNESS OF THAT RATHER FORGOTTEN LADY MISS MARTIN LEEDS
7067-76047-0042.flac,YOU I SAY ARE ALSO AT LOOSE ENDS CAN YOU DENY IT MY DEAR SIR DON'T WE BOTH KNOW THAT EVER SINCE WE LEFT LONDON YOU HAVE BEEN READY TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ANY PRETTY THING IN PETTICOATS THAT SEEMED TO PROMISE YOU THREE HA'PORTH OF KINDNESS
7067-76047-0043.flac,GROTESQUELY HAPPEN HE SAID SHE KNOWS NOTHING OF MARTIN LEEDS YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT AND THEN HE ADDED IF SHE AND YOU FALL IN LOVE
7067-76047-0044.flac,AS THE PHRASE GOES WHAT IS TO FOLLOW THERE WAS A PAUSE SIR RICHMOND LOOKED AT HIS TOES FOR A MOMENT OR SO AS IF HE TOOK COUNSEL WITH THEM AND THEN DECIDED TO TAKE OFFENCE
7067-76047-0045.flac,REALLY HE SAID THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS YOU TALK OF FALLING IN LOVE AS THOUGH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A MAN AND WOMAN TO BE DEEPLY INTERESTED IN EACH OTHER WITHOUT THAT AND THE GULF IN OUR AGES IN OUR QUALITY
7067-76047-0046.flac,FROM THE PSYCHOLOGIST OF A NEW AGE I FIND THIS AMAZING ARE MEN AND WOMEN TO GO ON FOR EVER SEPARATED BY THIS POSSIBILITY INTO TWO HARDLY COMMUNICATING AND YET INTERPENETRATING WORLDS
7067-76047-0047.flac,IS THERE NEVER TO BE FRIENDSHIP AND COMPANIONSHIP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN WITHOUT PASSION YOU OUGHT TO KNOW EVEN BETTER THAN I DO THAT THERE IS NOT FOR SUCH PEOPLE AS YOU TWO ANYHOW
7067-76047-0048.flac,AND AT PRESENT THE WORLD IS NOT PREPARED TO TOLERATE FRIENDSHIP AND COMPANIONSHIP WITH THAT ACCOMPANIMENT THAT IS THE CORE OF THIS SITUATION A PAUSE FELL BETWEEN THE TWO GENTLEMEN
7067-76047-0049.flac,THEY HAD SMOOTHED OVER THE EXTREME HARSHNESS OF THEIR SEPARATION AND THERE WAS VERY LITTLE MORE TO BE SAID WELL SAID SIR RICHMOND IN CONCLUSION I AM VERY SORRY INDEED MARTINEAU
7067-76048-0000.flac,I LEAVE YOU TO IT HIS ROUND FACE BETRAYED LITTLE OR NO VESTIGES OF HIS OVERNIGHT IRRITATION OUGHT YOU TO LEAVE ME TO IT SMILED SIR RICHMOND I SHALL BE INTERESTED TO LEARN WHAT HAPPENS BUT IF YOU WON'T STAY TO SEE
7067-76048-0001.flac,NOW SIR PLEASE SAID THE GUARD RESPECTFULLY BUT FIRMLY AND DOCTOR MARTINEAU GOT IN SIR RICHMOND WALKED THOUGHTFULLY DOWN THE PLATFORM TOWARDS THE EXIT WHAT ELSE COULD I DO HE ASKED ALOUD TO NOBODY IN PARTICULAR
7067-76048-0002.flac,SECTION TWO FOR THE BETTER PART OF FORTY HOURS SIR RICHMOND HAD EITHER BEEN TALKING TO MISS GRAMMONT OR CARRYING ON IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH HER IN HER ABSENCE
7067-76048-0003.flac,AND SHE REPEATED NO REMEMBERED COMMENTS AND PROPHETS OF HER CONTEMPORARIES ABOUT HERSELF SHE EITHER CONCEALED OR SHE HAD LOST ANY GREAT INTEREST IN HER OWN PERSONALITY
7067-76048-0004.flac,BUT SHE WAS INTERESTED IN AND CURIOUS ABOUT THE PEOPLE SHE HAD MET IN LIFE AND HER TALK OF THEM REFLECTED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LIGHT UPON HER OWN UPBRINGING AND EXPERIENCES AND HER LIKING FOR SIR RICHMOND WAS PLEASINGLY MANIFEST
7067-76048-0005.flac,SHE LIKED HIS TURN OF THOUGHT SHE WATCHED HIM WITH A FAINT SMILE ON HER LIPS AS HE SPOKE AND SHE SPREAD HER OPINIONS BEFORE HIM CAREFULLY IN THAT SOFT VOICE OF HERS LIKE A SHY CHILD SHOWING ITS TREASURES TO SOME SUDDENLY TRUSTED AND FAVOURED VISITOR
7067-76048-0006.flac,AS A CRISIS IN WHICH THEY WERE CALLED UPON TO DO SOMETHING THEY DID NOT YET CLEARLY KNOW WHAT INTO THIS TOPIC THEY PEERED AS INTO SOME DEEP POOL SIDE BY SIDE AND IN IT THEY SAW EACH OTHER REFLECTED
7067-76048-0007.flac,ITS DELIGHT WAS PARTICULARLY MANIFEST IN THE CREAM AND SALAD IT PRODUCED FOR LUNCH BOTH MISS GRAMMONT AND MISS SEYFFERT DISPLAYED AN INTELLIGENT INTEREST IN THEIR FOOD AFTER LUNCH THEY HAD ALL GONE OUT TO THE STONES AND THE WALL
7067-76048-0008.flac,TO A HAPPY USE BY CLAMBERING TO THE TOP OF IT AND SLIDING ON THEIR LITTLE BEHINDS DOWN ITS SMOOTH AND SLOPING SIDE AMIDST MUCH MIRTHFUL SQUEALING
7067-76048-0009.flac,SIR RICHMOND AND MISS GRAMMONT HAD WALKED ROUND THE OLD CIRCUMVALLATION TOGETHER BUT BELINDA SEYFFERT HAD STRAYED AWAY FROM THEM PROFESSING AN INTEREST IN FLOWERS
7067-76048-0010.flac,THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO TAKE THIS CONFUSED OLD WORLD AND RESHAPE IT SET IT MARCHING TOWARDS THAT NEW WORLD OF YOURS OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FULLY DEVELOPED BEAUTIFUL AND HAPPY PEOPLE WHY NOT
7067-76048-0011.flac,NOBODY IS DOING ANYTHING WITH THE WORLD EXCEPT MUDDLE ABOUT WHY NOT GIVE IT A DIRECTION YOU'D TAKE IT IN YOUR HANDS LIKE CLAY OBDURATE CLAY WITH A SORT OF RECALCITRANT UNINTELLIGENT LIFE OF ITS OWN
7067-76048-0012.flac,HER IMAGINATION GLOWED IN HER EYES AND WARMED HER VOICE I BELIEVE WHAT YOU SAY IS POSSIBLE IF PEOPLE DARE I AM TIRED OF FOLLOWING LITTLE MOTIVES THAT ARE LIKE FLAMES THAT GO OUT WHEN YOU GET TO THEM
7067-76048-0013.flac,I AM TIRED OF SEEING ALL THE WORLD DOING THE SAME I AM TIRED OF A WORLD IN WHICH THERE IS NOTHING GREAT BUT GREAT DISASTERS HERE IS SOMETHING MANKIND CAN ATTEMPT THAT WE CAN ATTEMPT AND WILL I BELIEVE THAT AS MANKIND GROWS UP
7067-76048-0014.flac,AND PRIDE OURSELVES UPON OUR FREEDOM FROM THE SIN OF PRESUMPTION NOT QUITE THAT WELL HOW DO YOU PUT IT WE ARE AFRAID SHE SAID IT'S TOO VAST WE WANT BRIGHT LITTLE LIVES OF OUR OWN
7067-76048-0015.flac,SENSIBLE LITTLE PIGGY WIGGYS WE HAVE A RIGHT TO LIFE AND HAPPINESS FIRST SAID SIR RICHMOND AS MUCH RIGHT AS A PIG HAS TO FOOD BUT WHETHER WE GET LIFE AND HAPPINESS OR FAIL TO GET THEM WE HUMAN BEINGS
7067-76048-0016.flac,WHO HAVE IMAGINATIONS WANT SOMETHING MORE NOWADAYS OF COURSE WE WANT BRIGHT LIVES OF COURSE WE WANT HAPPINESS JUST AS WE WANT FOOD JUST AS WE WANT SLEEP BUT WHEN WE HAVE EATEN WHEN WE HAVE SLEPT WHEN WE HAVE JOLLY THINGS ABOUT US IT IS NOTHING
7067-76048-0017.flac,WE HAVE BEEN MADE AN EXCEPTION OF AND GOT OUR RATIONS THE BIG THING CONFRONTS US STILL
7067-76048-0018.flac,I DO NOT KNOW WHY IT SHOULD BE SO BUT I AM COMPELLED BY SOMETHING IN MY NATURE TO WANT TO SERVE THIS IDEA OF A NEW AGE FOR MANKIND I WANT IT AS MY CULMINATING WANT I WANT A WORLD IN ORDER
7067-76048-0019.flac,A DISCIPLINED MANKIND GOING ON TO GREATER THINGS DON'T YOU NOW YOU TELL ME OF IT SHE SAID WITH A SMILE I DO BUT BEFORE NO YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR IT WASN'T CLEAR BEFORE
7067-76048-0020.flac,I'VE BEEN TALKING OF THIS SORT OF THING WITH MY FRIEND DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND I'VE BEEN THINKING AS WELL AS TALKING THAT PERHAPS IS WHY I'M SO CLEAR AND POSITIVE I DON'T COMPLAIN THAT YOU ARE CLEAR AND POSITIVE I'VE BEEN COMING ALONG THE SAME WAY
7067-76048-0021.flac,IT'S REFRESHING TO MEET YOU I FOUND IT REFRESHING TO MEET MARTINEAU A TWINGE OF CONSCIENCE ABOUT DOCTOR MARTINEAU TURNED SIR RICHMOND INTO A NEW CHANNEL HE'S A MOST INTERESTING MAN HE SAID RATHER SHY IN SOME RESPECTS
7067-76048-0022.flac,DEVOTED TO HIS WORK AND HE'S WRITING A BOOK WHICH HAS SATURATED HIM IN THESE IDEAS ONLY TWO NIGHTS AGO WE STOOD HERE AND TALKED ABOUT IT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A NEW AGE THE WORLD HE BELIEVES IS ENTERING UPON A NEW PHASE IN ITS HISTORY
7067-76048-0023.flac,THE ADOLESCENCE SO TO SPEAK OF MANKIND IT IS AN IDEA THAT SEIZES THE IMAGINATION THERE IS A FLOW OF NEW IDEAS ABROAD HE THINKS WIDENING REALIZATIONS UNPRECEDENTED HOPES AND FEARS
7067-76048-0024.flac,THERE IS A CONSCIOUSNESS OF NEW POWERS AND NEW RESPONSIBILITIES WE ARE SHARING THE ADOLESCENCE OF OUR RACE IT IS GIVING HISTORY A NEW AND MORE INTIMATE MEANING FOR US
7067-76048-0025.flac,MAKING THEM MATTER AS FORMERLY THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER THAT IDEA OF THE BRIGHT LITTLE PRIVATE LIFE HAS TO GO BY THE BOARD I SUPPOSE IT HAS SHE SAID MEDITATIVELY AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN THINKING OVER SOME SUCH QUESTION BEFORE
7067-76048-0026.flac,INCIDENTALLY HE SMILED I WANT TO GET A LASSO OVER THE NECK OF THAT VERY FORCIBLE AND BARBARIC PERSON YOUR FATHER I AM DOING MY BEST TO HELP LAY THE FOUNDATION OF A SCIENTIFIC WORLD CONTROL OF FUEL PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
7067-76048-0027.flac,BUT CONTROLLING FATHER AS DISTINGUISHED FROM MANAGING HIM SHE REVIEWED SOME PRIVATE AND AMUSING MEMORIES HE IS A MOST INTRACTABLE MAN SECTION THREE
7067-76048-0028.flac,THEY HAD GONE ON TO TALK OF HER FATHER AND OF THE TYPES OF MEN WHO CONTROLLED INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SHE HAD HAD PLENTIFUL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OBSERVATION IN THEIR HOMES AND HER OWN
7067-76048-0029.flac,GUNTER LAKE THE BIG BANKER SHE KNEW PARTICULARLY WELL BECAUSE IT SEEMED SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED OR WAS ENGAGED TO MARRY HIM ALL THESE PEOPLE SHE SAID ARE PUSHING THINGS ABOUT AFFECTING MILLIONS OF LIVES
7067-76048-0030.flac,YOU WILL FIND MY FATHER EXTREMELY DIFFICULT BUT SOME OF OUR YOUNGER MEN WOULD LOVE IT AND SHE WENT ON THERE ARE AMERICAN WOMEN WHO'D LOVE IT TOO WE'RE PETTED WE'RE KEPT OUT OF THINGS WE AREN'T PLACED
7067-76048-0031.flac,WE DON'T GET ENOUGH TO DO WE'RE SPENDERS AND WASTERS NOT ALWAYS FROM CHOICE WHILE THESE FATHERS AND BROTHERS AND HUSBANDS OF OURS PLAY ABOUT WITH THE FUEL AND POWER AND LIFE AND HOPE OF THE WORLD AS THOUGH IT WAS A GAME OF POKER
7067-76048-0032.flac,WITH ALL THE EMPTY UNSPEAKABLE SOLEMNITY OF THE MALE AND TREAT US AS THOUGH WE OUGHT TO BE SATISFIED IF THEY BRING HOME PART OF THE WINNINGS THAT CAN'T GO ON SHE SAID HER EYES WENT BACK TO THE LONG LOW UNDULATING SKYLINE OF THE DOWNS
7067-76048-0033.flac,SHE SPOKE AS THOUGH SHE TOOK UP THE THREAD OF SOME CONTROVERSY THAT HAD PLAYED A LARGE PART IN HER LIFE THAT ISN'T GOING ON SHE SAID WITH AN EFFECT OF CONCLUSIVE DECISION
7067-76048-0034.flac,SIR RICHMOND RECALLED THAT LITTLE SPEECH NOW AS HE RETURNED FROM SALISBURY STATION TO THE OLD GEORGE AFTER HIS FAREWELL TO MARTINEAU HE RECALLED TOO THE SOFT FIRMNESS OF HER PROFILE AND THE DELICATE LINE OF HER LIFTED CHIN
7067-76048-0035.flac,HE FELT THAT THIS TIME AT ANY RATE HE WAS NOT BEING DECEIVED BY THE OUTWARD SHOWS OF A CHARMING HUMAN BEING THIS YOUNG WOMAN HAD REAL FIRMNESS OF CHARACTER TO BACK UP HER FREE AND INDEPENDENT JUDGMENTS
7067-76048-0036.flac,IN THE COMPOSITION OF SO SURE AND GALLANT A PERSONALITY MARTINEAU WAS VERY FINE MINDED IN MANY RESPECTS BUT HE WAS AN OLD MAID AND LIKE ALL OLD MAIDS HE SAW MAN AND WOMAN IN EVERY ENCOUNTER
7067-76048-0037.flac,BUT PASSION WAS A THING MEN AND WOMEN FELL BACK UPON WHEN THEY HAD NOTHING ELSE IN COMMON WHEN THEY THOUGHT IN THE PLEASANTEST HARMONY AND EVERY REMARK SEEMED TO WEAVE A FRESH THREAD OF COMMON INTEREST THEN IT WASN'T SO NECESSARY IT MIGHT HAPPEN
7067-76048-0038.flac,HER VIEWS ABOUT AMERICA AND ABOUT HER OWN PLACE IN THE WORLD SEEMED EQUALLY FRESH AND ORIGINAL TO SIR RICHMOND I REALIZE I'VE GOT TO BE A RESPONSIBLE AMERICAN CITIZEN SHE HAD SAID
7067-76048-0039.flac,THAT DIDN'T MEAN THAT SHE ATTACHED VERY MUCH IMPORTANCE TO HER RECENTLY ACQUIRED VOTE SHE EVIDENTLY CLASSIFIED VOTERS INTO THE IRRESPONSIBLE WHO JUST HAD VOTES AND THE RESPONSIBLE WHO ALSO HAD A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY AS WELL
7067-76048-0040.flac,SHE HAD NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT THE POWER OF THE FORMER CLASS IT DIDN'T EXIST THEY WERE STEERED TO THEIR DECISIONS BY PEOPLE EMPLOYED DIRECTED OR STIMULATED BY FATHER AND HIS FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES THE OWNERS OF AMERICA THE REAL RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS
7067-76048-0041.flac,OR THEY FELL A PREY TO THE MERELY ADVENTUROUS LEADING OF REVOLUTIONARIES BUT ANYHOW THEY WERE STEERED SHE HERSELF IT WAS CLEAR WAS BOUND TO BECOME A VERY RESPONSIBLE CITIZEN INDEED
7067-76048-0042.flac,SHE WOULD SOME DAY SHE LAUGHED BE SWIMMING IN OIL AND SUCH LIKE PROPERTY HER INTEREST IN SIR RICHMOND'S SCHEMES FOR A SCIENTIFIC WORLD MANAGEMENT OF FUEL WAS THEREFORE SHE REALIZED A VERY DIRECT ONE BUT IT WAS REMARKABLE TO FIND A YOUNG WOMAN SEEING IT LIKE THAT
7067-76048-0043.flac,FATHER IT SEEMED VARIED VERY MUCH IN HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS HER HE DESPISED AND DISTRUSTED WOMEN GENERALLY AND IT WAS EVIDENT HE HAD MADE IT QUITE CLEAR TO HER HOW GRAVE AN ERROR IT WAS ON HER PART TO PERSIST IN BEING A DAUGHTER AND NOT A SON
7067-76048-0044.flac,AT MOMENTS IT SEEMED TO SIR RICHMOND THAT SHE WAS DISPOSED TO AGREE WITH FATHER UPON THAT WHEN MISTER GRAMMONT'S SENSE OF HER REGRETTABLE FEMININITY WAS UPPERMOST
7067-76048-0045.flac,AND THEN HE WOULD DIRECT HIS ATTENTION TO A KIND OF MASCULINIZATION OF HIS DAUGHTER AND TO SCHEMES FOR GIVING HER THE COMPLETEST CONTROL OF ALL HE HAD TO LEAVE HER PROVIDED SHE NEVER MARRIED NOR FELL UNDER MASCULINE SWAY AFTER ALL
7067-76048-0046.flac,HE WOULD REFLECT AS HE HESITATED OVER THE PRACTICABILITY OF HIS LIFE'S IDEAL THERE WAS HETTY GREEN THIS LATTER IDEA HAD REFT HER SUDDENLY AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN FROM THE EDUCATIONAL CARE OF AN ENGLISH GENTLEWOMAN WARRANTED TO FIT HER FOR MARRIAGE WITH ANY PRINCE IN EUROPE
7067-76048-0047.flac,AFTER A SWIFT BUT COMPETENT TRAINING INTO A SHIRT WAIST AND AN OFFICE DOWN TOWN SHE HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED AT FIRST TO A HARVESTER CONCERN INDEPENDENT OF MISTER GRAMMONT BECAUSE HE FEARED HIS OWN PEOPLE WOULDN'T TRAIN HER HARD
7067-76048-0048.flac,SHE HAD WORKED FOR ORDINARY WAGES AND ORDINARY HOURS AND AT THE END OF THE DAY SHE MENTIONED CASUALLY A LARGE AUTOMOBILE WITH TWO MENSERVANTS
7067-76048-0049.flac,THIS MASCULINIZATION IDEA HAD ALSO SENT HER ON A COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY INTO MEXICO THERE APPARENTLY SHE HAD REALLY DONE RESPONSIBLE WORK BUT UPON THE QUESTION OF LABOUR MISTER GRAMMONT WAS FIERCE
7067-76048-0050.flac,HE DISCOVERED HIS DAUGHTER DISPLAYING WHAT HE CONSIDERED AN IMPROPER FAMILIARITY WITH SOCIALIST IDEAS
7067-76048-0051.flac,AND THE IDEA OF A MATRIMONIAL ALLIANCE WITH GUNTER LAKE GUNTER LAKE SIR RICHMOND GATHERED WASN'T HALF A BAD FELLOW GENERALLY IT WOULD SEEM MISS GRAMMONT LIKED HIM AND SHE HAD A WAY OF SPEAKING ABOUT HIM THAT SUGGESTED THAT IN SOME WAY
7067-76048-0052.flac,MISTER LAKE HAD BEEN RATHER HARDLY USED AND HAD ACQUIRED MERIT BY HIS BEHAVIOUR UNDER BAD TREATMENT THERE WAS SOME STORY HOWEVER CONNECTED WITH HER WAR SERVICES IN EUROPE UPON WHICH MISS GRAMMONT WAS EVIDENTLY INDISPOSED TO DWELL
7067-76048-0053.flac,STILL QUITE VAGUELY GUESSING SO MUCH FACT ABOUT MISS GRAMMONT AS WE HAVE GIVEN HAD FLOATED UP IN FRAGMENTS AND PIECED ITSELF TOGETHER IN SIR RICHMOND'S MIND IN THE COURSE OF A DAY AND A HALF THE FRAGMENTS CAME UP AS ALLUSIONS OR BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION
7067-76048-0054.flac,THE SUSTAINING TOPIC WAS THIS NEW AGE SIR RICHMOND FORE SHADOWED THIS WORLD UNDER SCIENTIFIC CONTROL THE UTOPIA OF FULLY DEVELOPED PEOPLE FULLY DEVELOPING THE RESOURCES OF THE EARTH
7067-76048-0055.flac,FOR A NUMBER OF TRIVIAL REASONS SIR RICHMOND FOUND HIMSELF ASCRIBING THE PROJECT OF THIS NEW AGE ALMOST WHOLLY TO DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND PRESENTING IT AS A MUCH COMPLETER SCHEME THAN HE WAS JUSTIFIED IN DOING IT WAS TRUE THAT DOCTOR MARTINEAU HAD NOT SAID MANY OF THE THINGS SIR RICHMOND ASCRIBED TO HIM
7067-76048-0056.flac,BUT ALSO IT WAS TRUE THAT THEY HAD NOT CRYSTALLIZED OUT IN SIR RICHMOND'S MIND BEFORE HIS TALKS WITH DOCTOR MARTINEAU THE IDEA OF A NEW AGE NECESSARILY CARRIES WITH IT THE IDEA OF FRESH RULES OF CONDUCT AND OF DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HUMAN BEINGS
7067-76048-0057.flac,AND IT THROWS THOSE WHO TALK ABOUT IT INTO THE COMPANIONSHIP OF A COMMON ENTERPRISE TO MORROW THE NEW AGE WILL BE HERE NO DOUBT BUT TODAY IT IS THE HOPE AND ADVENTURE OF ONLY A FEW HUMAN BEINGS SO THAT IT WAS NATURAL FOR MISS GRAMMONT AND SIR RICHMOND TO ASK
7067-76048-0058.flac,WHAT ARE WE TO DO WITH SUCH TYPES AS FATHER AND TO FALL INTO AN IDIOM THAT ASSUMED A JOINT ENTERPRISE THEY HAD AGREED BY A TACIT CONSENT TO A COMMON CONCEPTION OF THE WORLD THEY DESIRED AS A WORLD SCIENTIFICALLY ORDERED
7067-76048-0059.flac,AN IMMENSE ORGANIZATION OF MATURE COMMONSENSE HEALTHY AND SECURE GATHERING KNOWLEDGE AND POWER FOR CREATIVE ADVENTURES AS YET BEYOND DREAMING
7067-76048-0060.flac,AND REPLACEABLE STRUCTURES INDEED BOTH THESE TWO PEOPLE FOUND THEMSELVES THINKING IN THIS FASHION WITH AN UNWONTED COURAGE AND FREEDOM BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE HAD BEEN DISPOSED TO THINK IN THIS FASHION BEFORE
460-172359-0000.flac,IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MINING BOOM AT THE TIME WHEN EVERYBODY WENT SIMPLY CRAZY OVER THE COBALT AND PORCUPINE MINES OF THE NEW SILVER COUNTRY NEAR THE HUDSON BAY
460-172359-0001.flac,THERE WERE ALWAYS PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP MULLINS THE MANAGER OF THE EXCHANGE BANK TOOK HIS MORNING SHAVE FROM JEFF AS A FORM OF RESUSCITATION WITH ENOUGH WET TOWELS LAID ON HIS FACE TO STEW HIM AND WITH JEFF MOVING ABOUT IN THE STEAM RAZOR IN HAND
460-172359-0002.flac,AS GRAVE AS AN OPERATING SURGEON THEN AS I THINK I SAID MISTER SMITH CAME IN EVERY MORNING AND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS OUTPOURING OF FLORIDA WATER AND RUMS ESSENCES AND REVIVERS AND RENOVATORS REGARDLESS OF EXPENSE
460-172359-0003.flac,WHAT WITH JEFF'S WHITE COAT AND MISTER SMITH'S FLOWERED WAISTCOAT AND THE RED GERANIUM IN THE WINDOW AND THE FLORIDA WATER AND THE DOUBLE EXTRACT OF HYACINTH THE LITTLE SHOP SEEMED MULTI COLOURED AND LUXURIOUS ENOUGH FOR THE ANNEX OF A SULTAN'S HAREM BUT WHAT I MEAN IS THAT
460-172359-0004.flac,TILL THE MINING BOOM JEFFERSON THORPE NEVER OCCUPIED A POSITION OF REAL PROMINENCE IN MARIPOSA
460-172359-0005.flac,EVERYBODY KNEW JEFF AND LIKED HIM BUT THE ODD THING WAS THAT TILL HE MADE MONEY NOBODY TOOK ANY STOCK IN HIS IDEAS AT ALL IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE MADE THE CLEAN UP THAT THEY CAME TO SEE WHAT A SPLENDID FELLOW HE WAS LEVEL HEADED I THINK WAS THE TERM INDEED
460-172359-0006.flac,IN THE SPEECH OF MARIPOSA THE HIGHEST FORM OF ENDOWMENT WAS TO HAVE THE HEAD SET ON HORIZONTALLY AS WITH A THEODOLITE AS I SAY IT WAS WHEN JEFF MADE MONEY THAT THEY SAW HOW GIFTED HE WAS AND WHEN HE LOST IT BUT STILL THERE'S NO NEED TO GO INTO THAT
460-172359-0007.flac,I BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THE SAME IN OTHER PLACES TOO THE BARBER SHOP YOU WILL REMEMBER STANDS ACROSS THE STREET FROM SMITH'S HOTEL AND STARES AT IT FACE TO FACE IT IS ONE OF THOSE WOODEN STRUCTURES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM
460-172359-0008.flac,WITH A FALSE FRONT THAT STICKS UP ABOVE ITS REAL HEIGHT AND GIVES IT AN AIR AT ONCE RECTANGULAR AND IMPOSING IT IS A FORM OF ARCHITECTURE MUCH USED IN MARIPOSA AND UNDERSTOOD TO BE IN KEEPING WITH THE PRETENTIOUS AND ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER OF MODERN BUSINESS
460-172359-0009.flac,AND THE SHOP ITSELF HAS A LARGE SQUARE WINDOW OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS LITTLE FLAT FACE PAINTED ON THE PANES OF THE WINDOW IS THE REMAINS OF A LEGEND THAT ONCE SPELT BARBER SHOP EXECUTED WITH THE FLOURISHES THAT PREVAILED IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF SIGN PAINTING IN MARIPOSA
460-172359-0010.flac,THROUGH THE WINDOW YOU CAN SEE THE GERANIUMS IN THE WINDOW SHELF AND BEHIND THEM JEFF THORPE WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK SCULL CAP ON AND HIS SPECTACLES DROOPED UPON HIS NOSE AS HE BENDS FORWARD IN THE ABSORPTION OF SHAVING
460-172359-0011.flac,AS YOU OPEN THE DOOR IT SETS IN VIOLENT AGITATION A COILED SPRING UP ABOVE AND A BELL THAT ALMOST RINGS INSIDE THERE ARE TWO SHAVING CHAIRS OF THE HEAVIER OR ELECTROCUTION PATTERN
460-172359-0012.flac,IT IS THE CURRENT SUPPOSITION OF EACH OF JEFF'S CUSTOMERS THAT EVERYONE ELSE BUT HIMSELF USES A SEPARATE MUG ONE CORNER OF THE SHOP IS PARTITIONED OFF AND BEARS THE SIGN HOT AND COLD BATHS FIFTY CENTS
460-172359-0013.flac,ONLY OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A MOP STILL IT LENDS DISTINCTION SOMEHOW JUST AS DO THE FADED CARDBOARD SIGNS THAT HANG AGAINST THE MIRROR WITH THE LEGENDS TURKISH SHAMPOO SEVENTY FIVE CENTS AND ROMAN MASSAGE ONE DOLLAR
460-172359-0014.flac,THEY SAID COMMONLY IN MARIPOSA THAT JEFF MADE MONEY OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP HE MAY HAVE AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT THAT TURNED HIS MIND TO INVESTMENT BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD A SHAVE COST FIVE CENTS AND A HAIR CUT FIFTEEN OR THE TWO IF YOU LIKED FOR A QUARTER
460-172359-0015.flac,AND AT THAT IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD MAKE MONEY
460-172359-0016.flac,AND THEN IN THE OTHER YOU SEE IN MARIPOSA SHAVING ISN'T THE HURRIED PERFUNCTORY THING THAT IT IS IN THE CITY A SHAVE IS LOOKED UPON AS A FORM OF PHYSICAL PLEASURE AND LASTS ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR IN THE MORNING HOURS PERHAPS THERE WAS A SEMBLANCE OF HASTE ABOUT IT
460-172359-0017.flac,THE RAZOR WOULD GO SLOWER AND SLOWER AND PAUSE AND STOP MOVE AND PAUSE AGAIN TILL THE SHAVE DIED AWAY INTO THE MERE DROWSE OF CONVERSATION AT SUCH HOURS THE MARIPOSA BARBER SHOP WOULD BECOME A VERY PALACE OF SLUMBER
460-172359-0018.flac,AND AS YOU WAITED YOUR TURN IN ONE OF THE WOODEN ARM CHAIRS BESIDE THE WALL WHAT WITH THE QUIET OF THE HOUR AND THE LOW DRONE OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION THE BUZZING OF THE FLIES AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE AND THE MEASURED TICK OF THE CLOCK ABOVE THE MIRROR
460-172359-0019.flac,YOUR HEAD SANK DREAMING ON YOUR BREAST AND THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET RUSTLED UNHEEDED ON THE FLOOR IT MAKES ONE DROWSY JUST TO THINK OF IT THE CONVERSATION OF COURSE WAS THE REAL CHARM OF THE PLACE YOU SEE JEFFERSON'S FORTE OR SPECIALTY WAS INFORMATION
460-172359-0020.flac,WHERE HE GOT IT ALL I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK IT CAME MORE OR LESS OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE CITY PEOPLE NEVER READ THE NEWSPAPERS NOT REALLY ONLY LITTLE BITS AND SCRAPS OF THEM BUT IN MARIPOSA IT'S DIFFERENT THERE
460-172359-0021.flac,THEY READ THE WHOLE THING FROM COVER TO COVER AND THEY BUILD UP ON IT IN THE COURSE OF YEARS A RANGE OF ACQUIREMENT THAT WOULD PUT A COLLEGE PRESIDENT TO THE BLUSH
460-172359-0022.flac,AND OF COURSE THE PECULIARITY OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION WAS THAT HE COULD SUIT IT TO HIS MAN EVERY TIME
460-172359-0023.flac,THERE WAS A CERTAIN KIND OF MAN THAT JEFF WOULD SIZE UP SIDEWAYS AS HE STROPPED THE RAZOR AND IN WHOSE EAR HE WOULD WHISPER I SEE WHERE SAINT LOUIS HAS TOOK FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES OFF CHICAGO AND SO HOLD HIM FASCINATED TO THE END IN THE SAME WAY HE WOULD SAY TO MISTER SMITH
460-172359-0024.flac,I SEE WHERE IT SAYS THAT THIS FLYING SQUIRL RUN A DEAD HEAT FOR THE KING'S PLATE TO A HUMBLE INTELLECT LIKE MINE HE WOULD EXPLAIN IN FULL THE RELATIONS OF THE KEESAR TO THE GERMAN RICH DOG
460-172359-0025.flac,THE HUGE FORTUNES THAT A MAN WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF HEAD COULD MAKE I'VE KNOWN JEFFERSON TO PAUSE IN HIS SHAVING WITH THE RAZOR SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AS LONG AS FIVE MINUTES WHILE HE DESCRIBED WITH HIS EYE HALF CLOSED
460-172359-0026.flac,EXACTLY THE KIND OF A HEAD A MAN NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE A HAUL OR A CLEAN UP IT WAS EVIDENTLY SIMPLY A MATTER OF THE HEAD AND AS FAR AS ONE COULD JUDGE JEFF'S OWN WAS THE VERY TYPE REQUIRED I DON'T KNOW JUST AT WHAT TIME OR HOW JEFFERSON FIRST BEGAN HIS SPECULATIVE ENTERPRISES
460-172359-0027.flac,IT WAS PROBABLY IN HIM FROM THE START THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH THINGS AS TRACTION STOCK AND AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS WENT TO HIS HEAD AND WHENEVER HE SPOKE OF MISTER CARNEGIE AND MISTER ROCKEFELLER THE YEARNING TONE OF HIS VOICE MADE IT AS SOFT AS LATHERED SOAP
460-172359-0028.flac,I SUPPOSE THE MOST RUDIMENTARY FORM OF HIS SPECULATION WAS THE HENS THAT WAS YEARS AGO HE KEPT THEM OUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HOUSE WHICH ITSELF STOOD UP A GRASS PLOT BEHIND AND BEYOND THE BARBER SHOP AND IN THE OLD DAYS JEFF WOULD SAY WITH A CERTAIN NOTE OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE
460-172359-0029.flac,THAT THE WOMAN HAD SOLD AS MANY AS TWO DOZEN EGGS IN A DAY TO THE SUMMER VISITORS BUT WHAT WITH READING ABOUT AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS AND CONSOLIDATED COPPER AND ALL THAT THE HENS BEGAN TO SEEM PRETTY SMALL BUSINESS AND IN ANY CASE THE IDEA OF TWO DOZEN EGGS AT A CENT APIECE ALMOST MAKES ONE BLUSH
460-172359-0030.flac,I SUPPOSE A GOOD MANY OF US HAVE FELT JUST AS JEFF DID ABOUT OUR POOR LITTLE EARNINGS ANYWAY I REMEMBER JEFF TELLING ME ONE DAY THAT HE COULD TAKE THE WHOLE LOT OF THE HENS AND SELL THEM OFF AND CRACK THE MONEY INTO CHICAGO WHEAT ON MARGIN AND TURN IT OVER IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE DID IT TOO
460-172359-0031.flac,AFTER THAT THE HEN HOUSE STOOD EMPTY AND THE WOMAN HAD TO THROW AWAY CHICKEN FEED EVERY DAY AT A DEAD LOSS OF PERHAPS A SHAVE AND A HALF
460-172359-0032.flac,AND RIGHT AT OUR VERY DOORS YOU COULD SEE AS I SAW THE NIGHT EXPRESS GOING NORTH EVERY EVENING FOR ALL ONE KNEW ROCKEFELLER OR CARNEGIE OR ANYONE MIGHT BE ON IT
460-172359-0033.flac,SO NO WONDER THE TOWN WENT WILD ALL DAY IN THE STREET YOU COULD HEAR MEN TALKING OF VEINS AND SMELTERS AND DIPS AND DEPOSITS AND FAULTS THE TOWN HUMMED WITH IT LIKE A GEOLOGY CLASS ON EXAMINATION DAY
460-172359-0034.flac,WITHIN A FORTNIGHT THEY PUT A PARTITION DOWN ROBERTSON'S COAL AND WOOD OFFICE AND OPENED THE MARIPOSA MINING EXCHANGE AND JUST ABOUT EVERY MAN ON THE MAIN STREET STARTED BUYING SCRIP THEN PRESENTLY YOUNG FIZZLECHIP WHO HAD BEEN TELLER IN MULLINS'S BANK AND THAT EVERYBODY HAD THOUGHT A WORTHLESS JACKASS BEFORE
460-172359-0035.flac,CAME BACK FROM THE COBALT COUNTRY WITH A FORTUNE AND LOAFED ROUND IN THE MARIPOSA HOUSE IN ENGLISH KHAKI AND A HORIZONTAL HAT DRUNK ALL THE TIME
460-172359-0036.flac,THEY ALL WENT IN JIM ELIOT MORTGAGED THE INSIDE OF THE DRUG STORE AND JAMMED IT INTO TWIN TAMAGAMI PETE GLOVER AT THE HARDWARE STORE BOUGHT NIPPEWA STOCK AT THIRTEEN CENTS AND SOLD IT TO HIS BROTHER AT SEVENTEEN AND BOUGHT IT BACK IN LESS THAN A WEEK AT NINETEEN THEY DIDN'T CARE THEY TOOK A CHANCE
460-172359-0037.flac,JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH PUT THE REST OF HIS WIFE'S MONEY INTO TEMISKAMING COMMON AND LAWYER MACARTNEY GOT THE FEVER TOO AND PUT EVERY CENT THAT HIS SISTER POSSESSED INTO TULIP PREFERRED AND EVEN WHEN YOUNG FIZZLECHIP SHOT HIMSELF IN THE BACK ROOM OF THE MARIPOSA HOUSE MISTER GINGHAM BURIED HIM IN A CASKET WITH SILVER HANDLES
460-172359-0038.flac,THEY ALL WENT IN OR ALL EXCEPT MISTER SMITH YOU SEE MISTER SMITH HAD COME DOWN FROM THERE AND HE KNEW ALL ABOUT ROCKS AND MINING AND CANOES AND THE NORTH COUNTRY HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO EAT FLOUR BAKED DAMPERS UNDER THE LEE SIDE OF A CANOE PROPPED AMONG THE UNDERBRUSH
460-172359-0039.flac,BUT JEFF THORPE WAS IN THE MINING BOOM RIGHT FROM THE START HE BOUGHT IN ON THE NIPPEWA MINE EVEN BEFORE THE INTERIM PROSPECTUS WAS OUT
460-172359-0040.flac,AND HE AND JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLEKEEPER NEXT DOOR FORMED A SYNDICATE
460-172359-0041.flac,AND THEN UNLOADED THEM ON ONE OF THE SAUSAGE MEN AT NETLEY'S BUTCHER SHOP AT A CLEAR CENT PER CENT ADVANCE JEFF WOULD OPEN THE LITTLE DRAWER BELOW THE MIRROR IN THE BARBER SHOP AND SHOW YOU ALL KINDS AND SORTS OF COBALT COUNTRY MINING CERTIFICATES
460-172359-0042.flac,BLUE ONES PINK ONES GREEN ONES WITH OUTLANDISH AND FASCINATING NAMES ON THEM THAT RAN CLEAR FROM THE MATTAWA TO THE HUDSON BAY AND RIGHT FROM THE START HE WAS CONFIDENT OF WINNING THERE AIN'T NO DIFFICULTY TO IT HE SAID
460-172359-0043.flac,I DON'T SAY HE USED TO CONTINUE WITH THE SCISSORS OPEN AND READY TO CUT
460-172359-0044.flac,BUT IF A FELLER KNOWS THE COUNTRY AND KEEPS HIS HEAD LEVEL HE CAN'T LOSE JEFFERSON HAD LOOKED AT SO MANY PROSPECTUSES AND SO MANY PICTURES OF MINES AND PINE TREES AND SMELTERS THAT I THINK HE'D FORGOTTEN THAT HE'D NEVER BEEN IN THE COUNTRY ANYWAY WHAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILES
460-172359-0045.flac,TO AN ONLOOKER IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T SEEM SO SIMPLE I NEVER KNEW THE MEANNESS THE TRICKERY OF THE MINING BUSINESS THE SHEER OBSTINATE DETERMINATION OF THE BIGGER CAPITALISTS NOT TO MAKE MONEY WHEN THEY MIGHT TILL I HEARD THE ACCOUNTS OF JEFF'S DIFFERENT MINES TAKE THE CASE OF CORONA JEWEL
460-172359-0046.flac,THERE WAS A GOOD MINE SIMPLY GOING TO RUIN FOR LACK OF COMMON SENSE SHE AIN'T BEEN DEVELOPED JEFF WOULD SAY THERE'S SILVER ENOUGH IN HER SO YOU COULD DIG IT OUT WITH A SHOVEL SHE'S FULL OF IT BUT THEY WON'T GET AT HER AND WORK HER
460-172359-0047.flac,THEN HE'D TAKE A LOOK AT THE PINK AND BLUE CERTIFICATES OF THE CORONA JEWEL AND SLAM THE DRAWER ON THEM IN DISGUST WORSE THAN THAT WAS THE SILENT PINE A CLEAR CASE OF STUPID INCOMPETENCE
460-172359-0048.flac,UTTER LACK OF ENGINEERING SKILL WAS ALL THAT WAS KEEPING THE SILENT PINE FROM MAKING A FORTUNE FOR ITS HOLDERS THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH THAT MINE SAID JEFF IS THEY WON'T GO DEEP ENOUGH
460-172359-0049.flac,IF THEY'D JUST GO RIGHT INTO HER GOOD THEY'D GET IT AGAIN SHE'S DOWN THERE ALL RIGHT BUT PERHAPS THE MEANEST CASE OF ALL WAS THE NORTHERN STAR THAT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME EVERY TIME I HEARD OF IT A STRAIGHT CASE FOR THE CRIMINAL LAW THE THING WAS SO EVIDENTLY A CONSPIRACY
460-172359-0050.flac,I BOUGHT HER SAID JEFF AT THIRTY TWO AND SHE STAYED RIGHT THERE TIGHT LIKE SHE WAS STUCK
460-172359-0051.flac,AND I HELD ON TO HER AND THEY SHOVED HER DOWN TO TWENTY ONE THIS MORNING THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO SIXTEEN BUT I DON'T MEAN TO LET GO NO SIR IN ANOTHER FORTNIGHT THEY SHOVED HER THE SAME UNSCRUPULOUS CROWD DOWN TO NINE CENTS AND JEFFERSON STILL HELD ON
460-172359-0052.flac,A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT THE SAME CRIMINAL GANG HAD HER DOWN FURTHER THAN EVER THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO THREE CENTS SAID JEFF BUT I'M WITH HER YES SIR THEY THINK THEY CAN SHOVE HER CLEAN OFF THE MARKET BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT I'VE BOUGHTEN IN JOHNSON'S SHARES
460-172359-0053.flac,AND THEN AND THEN WELL THAT'S JUST THE QUEER THING ABOUT THE MINING BUSINESS WHY SUDDEN AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IT SEEMED THE NEWS CAME OVER THE WIRE TO THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET THAT THEY HAD STRUCK A VEIN OF SILVER IN THE NORTHERN STAR AS THICK AS A SIDEWALK
460-172359-0054.flac,AND THAT THE STOCK HAD JUMPED TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A SHARE AND EVEN AT THAT YOU COULDN'T GET IT AND JEFF STOOD THERE FLUSHED AND HALF STAGGERED AGAINST THE MIRROR OF THE LITTLE SHOP WITH A BUNCH OF MINING SCRIP IN HIS HAND THAT WAS WORTH FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
460-172359-0055.flac,EXCITEMENT IT WAS ALL OVER THE TOWN IN A MINUTES
460-172359-0056.flac,AND IN LESS THAN NO TIME THERE WASN'T STANDING ROOM IN THE BARBER SHOP AND OVER IN SMITH'S HOTEL THEY HAD THREE EXTRA BARKEEPERS WORKING ON THE LAGER BEER PUMPS
460-172359-0057.flac,AND PEOPLE WERE JUST CLUTCHING FOR THEM THEN AT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG OYSTER SUPPER IN SMITH'S CAFF WITH SPEECHES AND THE MARIPOSA BAND OUTSIDE AND THE QUEER THING WAS THAT THE VERY NEXT AFTERNOON WAS THE FUNERAL OF YOUNG FIZZLECHIP
460-172359-0058.flac,A PERFECT ILIAD WHILE HE WAS CLINGING TO HER THE WHOLE THING WAS IN THE CITY PAPERS A FEW DAYS AFTER WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF JEFF TAKEN SPECIALLY AT ED MOORE'S STUDIO UPSTAIRS OVER NETLEY'S IT SHOWED JEFF SITTING AMONG PALM TREES AS ALL MINING MEN DO
460-172359-0059.flac,WITH ONE HAND ON HIS KNEE AND A DOG ONE OF THOSE REGULAR MINING DOGS AT HIS FEET AND A LOOK OF PIERCING INTELLIGENCE IN HIS FACE THAT WOULD EASILY ACCOUNT FOR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I SAY THAT THE RECOGNITION MEANT A LOT TO JEFF FOR ITS OWN SAKE
460-172359-0060.flac,THAT UNLESS YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM SEPARATELY AND ONE BY ONE YOU CAN'T FOR A MOMENT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
460-172359-0061.flac,ON HER HIGH STOOL WITH A STEEL CAP ON JABBING THE CONNECTING PLUGS IN AND OUT AS IF ELECTRICITY COST NOTHING WELL
460-172359-0062.flac,THERE WAS MYRA WHO TREATED LOVERS LIKE DOGS AND WOULD SLAP THEM ACROSS THE FACE WITH A BANANA SKIN TO SHOW HER UTTER INDEPENDENCE AND THERE WAS MISS CLEGHORN WHO WAS SALLOW AND WHO BOUGHT A FORTY CENT ANCIENT HISTORY TO IMPROVE HERSELF AND YET IF SHE'D HIT ANY MAN IN MARIPOSA WITH A BANANA SKIN
460-172359-0063.flac,HE'D HAVE HAD HER ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT MIND YOU I DON'T MEAN THAT MYRA WAS MERELY FLIPPANT AND WORTHLESS NOT AT ALL SHE WAS A GIRL WITH ANY AMOUNT OF TALENT YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HER RECITE THE RAVEN AT THE METHODIST SOCIAL SIMPLY GENIUS
460-172359-0064.flac,AND WHEN SHE ACTED PORTIA IN THE TRIAL SCENE OF THE MERCHANT OF VENICE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL CONCERT
460-172359-0065.flac,SO OF COURSE AS SOON AS JEFF MADE THE FORTUNE MYRA HAD HER RESIGNATION IN NEXT MORNING
460-172359-0066.flac,AND BECOME A LEADING ACTRESS BUT AS I SAID THE PUBLIC RECOGNITION COUNTED A LOT FOR JEFF THE MOMENT YOU BEGIN TO GET THAT SORT OF THING IT COMES IN QUICKLY ENOUGH BRAINS YOU KNOW ARE RECOGNIZED RIGHT AWAY THAT WAS WHY OF COURSE WITHIN A WEEK FROM THIS
460-172359-0067.flac,JEFF RECEIVED THE FIRST BIG PACKET OF STUFF FROM THE CUBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY WITH COLOURED PICTURES OF CUBA AND FIELDS OF BANANAS AND HACIENDAS AND INSURRECTOS WITH MACHETES AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT THEY HEARD OF HIM SOMEHOW IT WASN'T FOR A MODEST MAN LIKE JEFFERSON TO SAY HOW
460-172359-0068.flac,FOR ALL I KNOW THIS CUBAN STUFF MAY HAVE BEEN SENT FROM MORGAN HIMSELF SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MARIPOSA SAID YES OTHERS SAID NO THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY ANYWAY THEY WERE FAIR AND STRAIGHT THIS CUBAN CROWD THAT WROTE TO JEFF
460-172359-0069.flac,AND THAT TOUCHES YOU NO THEY ASKED NO GUARANTEE JUST SEND THE MONEY WHETHER BY EXPRESS ORDER OR BY BANK DRAFT OR CHEQUE THEY LEFT THAT ENTIRELY TO ONESELF AS A MATTER BETWEEN CUBAN GENTLEMEN AND THEY WERE QUITE FRANK ABOUT THEIR ENTERPRISE
460-172359-0070.flac,BANANAS AND TOBACCO IN THE PLANTATION DISTRICT RECLAIMED FROM THE INSURRECTOS YOU COULD SEE IT ALL THERE IN THE PICTURES
460-172359-0071.flac,THEY MADE NO RASH PROMISES JUST ADMITTED STRAIGHT OUT THAT THE ENTERPRISE MIGHT REALISE FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT
460-172359-0072.flac,I LIKED IT ABOUT JEFF THAT HE DIDN'T STOP SHAVING HE WENT ON JUST THE SAME EVEN WHEN JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLE MAN CAME IN WITH FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ASKED HIM TO SEE IF THE CUBAN BOARD OF DIRECTORS WOULD LET HIM PUT IT IN JEFF LAID IT IN THE DRAWER AND THEN SHAVED HIM FOR FIVE CENTS IN THE SAME OLD WAY
460-172359-0073.flac,A FEW DAYS LATER HE GOT A LETTER FROM THE CUBAN PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK ACCEPTING THE MONEY STRAIGHT OFF WITHOUT A SINGLE QUESTION AND WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING MORE OF JOHNSON EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A FRIEND OF JEFF'S THEY WROTE MOST HANDSOMELY ANY FRIENDS OF JEFF'S WERE FRIENDS OF CUBA
460-172359-0074.flac,ALL MONEY THEY MIGHT SEND WOULD BE TREATED JUST AS JEFF'S WOULD BE TREATED ONE REASON PERHAPS WHY JEFF DIDN'T GIVE UP SHAVING WAS BECAUSE IT ALLOWED HIM TO TALK ABOUT CUBA
460-172359-0075.flac,AND THAT SPREAD ROUND HIM A KIND OF HALO OF WEALTH AND MYSTERY AND OUTLANDISHNESS OH SOMETHING SPANISH PERHAPS YOU'VE FELT IT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW ANYHOW THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT THE CLIMATE AND YELLOW FEVER AND WHAT THE NEGROES WERE LIKE AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
460-172359-0076.flac,AND FOR FRUIT THEY SAY IT COMES UP SO FAST YOU CAN'T STOP IT AND THEN HE WOULD PASS INTO DETAILS ABOUT THE HASH ENDERS AND THE RESURRECTOS AND TECHNICAL THINGS LIKE THAT TILL IT WAS THOUGHT A WONDER HOW HE COULD KNOW IT STILL IT WAS REALIZED THAT A MAN WITH MONEY HAS GOT TO KNOW THESE THINGS
460-172359-0077.flac,LOOK AT MORGAN AND ROCKEFELLER AND ALL THE MEN THAT MAKE A PILE THEY KNOW JUST AS MUCH AS JEFF DID ABOUT THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY MAKE IT IT STANDS TO REASON DID I SAY THAT JEFF SHAVED IN THE SAME OLD WAY NOT QUITE
460-172359-0078.flac,I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS GETTING SO MUCH MONEY WELL YOU KNOW THE WAY IT ACTS ON PEOPLE IN THE LARGER CITIES IT SEEMED TO SPOIL ONE'S IDEA OF JEFF THAT COPPER AND ASBESTOS AND BANANA LANDS SHOULD FORM THE GOAL OF HIS THOUGHT WHEN IF HE KNEW IT
460-172359-0079.flac,IN FACT I HAD PERHAPS BORNE HIM A GRUDGE FOR WHAT SEEMED TO ME HIS PERPETUAL INTEREST IN THE GREAT CAPITALISTS HE ALWAYS HAD SOME ITEM OUT OF THE PAPER ABOUT THEM
460-172359-0080.flac,HE WOULD SAY AND ANOTHER DAY HE WOULD PAUSE IN THE COURSE OF SHAVING AND ALMOST WHISPER DID YOU EVER SEE THIS ROCKEFELLER IT WAS ONLY BY A SORT OF ACCIDENT THAT I CAME TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDE TO JEFFERSON'S SPECULATION THAT NO ONE IN MARIPOSA EVER KNEW OR WILL EVER KNOW NOW
460-172359-0081.flac,YOU COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP BEHIND THE BLIND AND THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR AS YOU CAME ALONG
460-172359-0082.flac,THERE WAS A ROUND TABLE THAT THE WOMAN USED TO LAY FOR SUPPER
460-172359-0083.flac,AND BESIDE IT JEFF WOULD SIT WITH HIS SPECTACLES ON AND THE PAPER SPREAD OUT READING ABOUT CARNEGIE AND ROCKEFELLER NEAR HIM BUT AWAY FROM THE TABLE WAS THE WOMAN DOING NEEDLEWORK AND MYRA WHEN SHE WASN'T WORKING IN THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE WAS THERE TOO WITH HER ELBOWS ON THE TABLE READING MARIE CORELLI
460-172359-0084.flac,JEFF LAID DOWN WHAT HE WAS READING AND STARTED TO TALK ABOUT CARNEGIE THIS CARNEGIE I BET YOU WOULD BE WORTH SAID JEFF CLOSING UP HIS EYES IN CALCULATION AS MUCH AS PERHAPS TWO MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU WAS TO SELL HIM UP
460-172359-0085.flac,I MAY SAY IN PARENTHESES THAT IT WAS A FAVOURITE METHOD IN MARIPOSA IF YOU WANTED TO GET AT THE REAL WORTH OF A MAN TO IMAGINE HIM CLEAN SOLD UP PUT UP FOR AUCTION AS IT WERE IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO TEST HIM AND NOW LOOK AT EM JEFF WENT ON
460-172359-0086.flac,THEY GIVE IT AWAY AND WHO DO THEY GIVE IT TO WHY TO THOSE AS DON'T WANT IT EVERY TIME THEY GIVE IT TO THESE PROFESSORS AND TO THIS RESEARCH AND THAT AND DO THE POOR GET ANY OF IT NOT A CENT AND NEVER WILL I TELL YOU BOYS CONTINUED JEFF
460-172359-0087.flac,THERE WERE NO BOYS PRESENT BUT IN MARIPOSA ALL REALLY IMPORTANT SPEECHES ARE ADDRESSED TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE OF BOYS I TELL YOU IF I WAS TO MAKE A MILLION OUT OF THIS CUBEY I'D GIVE IT STRAIGHT TO THE POOR YES SIR DIVIDE IT UP INTO A HUNDRED LOTS OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH AND GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT HADN'T NOTHING
460-172359-0088.flac,SO ALWAYS AFTER THAT I KNEW JUST WHAT THOSE BANANAS WERE BEING GROWN FOR INDEED AFTER THAT THOUGH JEFFERSON NEVER SPOKE OF HIS INTENTIONS DIRECTLY HE SAID A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT SEEMED TO BEAR ON THEM
460-172359-0089.flac,HE ASKED ME FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY HOW MANY BLIND PEOPLE IT WOULD TAKE TO FILL ONE OF THESE BLIND HOMES AND HOW A FELLER COULD GET AHOLD OF THEM
460-172359-0090.flac,A FELLER COULD GET ENOUGH OF THEM TO MAKE A SHOWING
460-172359-0091.flac,BUT STILL WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING OF WHAT JEFF MEANT TO DO NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES ABOUT IT NOW THE END OF IT WAS BOUND TO COME EVEN IN MARIPOSA SOME OF THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT SO
460-172359-0092.flac,ELSE HOW WAS IT THAT HENRY MULLINS MADE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT SELLING A DRAFT FOR FORTY THOUSAND ON NEW YORK AND WHY WAS IT THAT MISTER SMITH WOULDN'T PAY BILLY THE DESK CLERK HIS BACK WAGES WHEN HE WANTED TO PUT IT INTO CUBA OH YES SOME OF THEM MUST HAVE SEEN IT
460-172359-0093.flac,AND YET WHEN IT CAME IT SEEMED SO QUIET EVER SO QUIET NOT A BIT LIKE THE NORTHERN STAR MINE AND THE OYSTER SUPPER AND THE MARIPOSA BAND IT IS STRANGE HOW QUIET THESE THINGS LOOK THE OTHER WAY ROUND
460-172359-0094.flac,YOU REMEMBER THE CUBAN LAND FRAUDS IN NEW YORK AND PORFORIO GOMEZ SHOOTING THE DETECTIVE AND HIM AND MAXIMO MOREZ GETTING CLEAR AWAY WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NO OF COURSE YOU DON'T WHY EVEN IN THE CITY PAPERS IT ONLY FILLED AN INCH OR TWO OF TYPE AND ANYWAY THE NAMES WERE HARD TO REMEMBER
460-172359-0095.flac,THAT WAS JEFF'S MONEY PART OF IT MULLINS GOT THE TELEGRAM FROM A BROKER OR SOMEONE AND HE SHOWED IT TO JEFF JUST AS HE WAS GOING UP THE STREET WITH AN ESTATE AGENT TO LOOK AT A BIG EMPTY LOT ON THE HILL BEHIND THE TOWN THE VERY PLACE FOR THESE INCURABLES
460-172359-0096.flac,AND JEFF WENT BACK TO THE SHOP SO QUIET HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN ANIMAL THAT IS STRICKEN THROUGH HOW QUIET IT SEEMS TO MOVE
460-172359-0097.flac,AND SINCE THAT THOUGH IT'S QUITE A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE SHOP'S OPEN TILL ELEVEN EVERY NIGHT NOW AND JEFF IS SHAVING AWAY TO PAY BACK THAT FIVE HUNDRED THAT JOHNSON THE LIVERY MAN SENT TO THE CUBANS AND PATHETIC TUT TUT YOU DON'T KNOW MARIPOSA
460-172359-0098.flac,JEFF HAS TO WORK PRETTY LATE BUT THAT'S NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL IF YOU'VE WORKED HARD ALL YOUR LIFETIME
460-172359-0099.flac,THEY WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO GET HER AND SHE SAYS NOW THAT IF THERE'S ONE THING SHE HATES IT'S THE STAGE AND SHE CAN'T SEE HOW THE ACTRESSES PUT UP WITH IT ANYWAY THINGS ARE NOT SO BAD
460-172357-0000.flac,I KNOW NO WAY IN WHICH A WRITER MAY MORE FITTINGLY INTRODUCE HIS WORK TO THE PUBLIC THAN BY GIVING A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF WHO AND WHAT HE IS BY THIS MEANS SOME OF THE BLAME FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE IS VERY PROPERLY SHIFTED TO THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS LIFE
460-172357-0001.flac,MY PARENTS MIGRATED TO CANADA IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX AND I DECIDED TO GO WITH THEM MY FATHER TOOK UP A FARM NEAR LAKE SIMCOE IN ONTARIO THIS WAS DURING THE HARD TIMES OF CANADIAN FARMING
460-172357-0002.flac,AND MY FATHER WAS JUST ABLE BY GREAT DILIGENCE TO PAY THE HIRED MEN AND IN YEARS OF PLENTY TO RAISE ENOUGH GRAIN TO HAVE SEED FOR THE NEXT YEAR'S CROP WITHOUT BUYING ANY BY THIS PROCESS MY BROTHERS AND I WERE INEVITABLY DRIVEN OFF THE LAND
460-172357-0003.flac,THAT IS INDUCED BY HONEST MANUAL TOIL I WAS EDUCATED AT UPPER CANADA COLLEGE TORONTO OF WHICH I WAS HEAD BOY IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FROM THERE I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO WHERE I GRADUATED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE
460-172357-0004.flac,AT THE UNIVERSITY I SPENT MY ENTIRE TIME IN THE ACQUISITION OF LANGUAGES LIVING DEAD AND HALF DEAD AND KNEW NOTHING OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN THIS DILIGENT PURSUIT OF WORDS I SPENT ABOUT SIXTEEN HOURS OF EACH DAY
460-172357-0005.flac,IN OTHER WORDS I WAS WHAT IS CALLED A DISTINGUISHED GRADUATE AND AS SUCH I TOOK TO SCHOOL TEACHING AS THE ONLY TRADE I COULD FIND THAT NEED NEITHER EXPERIENCE NOR INTELLECT I SPENT MY TIME FROM EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE TO EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE ON THE STAFF OF UPPER CANADA COLLEGE
460-172357-0006.flac,AN EXPERIENCE WHICH HAS LEFT ME WITH A PROFOUND SYMPATHY FOR THE MANY GIFTED AND BRILLIANT MEN WHO ARE COMPELLED TO SPEND THEIR LIVES IN THE MOST DREARY THE MOST THANKLESS AND THE WORST PAID PROFESSION IN THE WORLD
460-172357-0007.flac,AND BY MEANS OF THIS AND SOME TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT BY MC GILL UNIVERSITY I SURVIVED UNTIL I TOOK THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN NINETEEN O THREE THE MEANING OF THIS DEGREE IS THAT THE RECIPIENT OF INSTRUCTION IS EXAMINED FOR THE LAST TIME IN HIS LIFE AND IS PRONOUNCED COMPLETELY FULL
460-172357-0008.flac,AFTER THIS NO NEW IDEAS CAN BE IMPARTED TO HIM FROM THIS TIME AND SINCE MY MARRIAGE WHICH HAD OCCURRED AT THIS PERIOD I HAVE BELONGED TO THE STAFF OF MC GILL UNIVERSITY FIRST AS LECTURER IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND LATER AS HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
460-172357-0009.flac,I AM ABLE TO REGARD MYSELF AS SINGULARLY FORTUNATE THE EMOLUMENT IS SO HIGH AS TO PLACE ME DISTINCTLY ABOVE THE POLICEMEN POSTMEN STREET CAR CONDUCTORS AND OTHER SALARIED OFFICIALS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
460-172357-0010.flac,WHILE I AM ABLE TO MIX WITH THE POORER OF THE BUSINESS MEN OF THE CITY ON TERMS OF SOMETHING LIKE EQUALITY IN POINT OF LEISURE I ENJOY MORE IN THE FOUR CORNERS OF A SINGLE YEAR THAN A BUSINESS MAN KNOWS IN HIS WHOLE LIFE I THUS HAVE WHAT THE BUSINESS MAN CAN NEVER ENJOY
460-172357-0011.flac,AN ABILITY TO THINK AND WHAT IS STILL BETTER TO STOP THINKING ALTOGETHER FOR MONTHS AT A TIME I HAVE WRITTEN A NUMBER OF THINGS IN CONNECTION WITH MY COLLEGE LIFE A BOOK ON POLITICAL SCIENCE AND MANY ESSAYS MAGAZINE ARTICLES AND SO ON
460-172357-0012.flac,A FEW YEARS AGO I WENT ALL ROUND THE BRITISH EMPIRE DELIVERING ADDRESSES ON IMPERIAL ORGANIZATION WHEN I STATE THAT THESE LECTURES WERE FOLLOWED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BY THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA THE BANANA RIOTS IN TRINIDAD AND THE TURCO ITALIAN WAR
460-172357-0013.flac,NOR TO CONSTRUCT EVEN THE SMALLEST SECTION OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY THIS HOWEVER IS A FORM OF NATIONAL INGRATITUDE TO WHICH ONE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED IN THIS DOMINION APART FROM MY COLLEGE WORK I HAVE WRITTEN TWO BOOKS ONE CALLED LITERARY LAPSES
460-172357-0014.flac,AND THE OTHER NONSENSE NOVELS EACH OF THESE IS PUBLISHED BY JOHN LANE LONDON AND NEW YORK AND EITHER OF THEM CAN BE OBTAINED ABSURD THOUGH IT SOUNDS FOR THE MERE SUM OF THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE ANY READER OF THIS PREFACE FOR EXAMPLE RIDICULOUS THOUGH IT APPEARS
460-172357-0015.flac,COULD WALK INTO A BOOKSTORE AND BUY BOTH OF THESE BOOKS FOR SEVEN SHILLINGS YET THESE WORKS ARE OF SO HUMOROUS A CHARACTER THAT FOR MANY YEARS IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO PRINT THEM THE COMPOSITORS FELL BACK FROM THEIR TASK SUFFOCATED WITH LAUGHTER AND GASPING FOR AIR
460-172357-0016.flac,MANY OF MY FRIENDS ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WRITE THESE HUMOROUS NOTHINGS IN IDLE MOMENTS WHEN THE WEARIED BRAIN IS UNABLE TO PERFORM THE SERIOUS LABOURS OF THE ECONOMIST MY OWN EXPERIENCE IS EXACTLY THE OTHER WAY
460-172357-0017.flac,BUT TO WRITE SOMETHING OUT OF ONE'S OWN MIND WORTH READING FOR ITS OWN SAKE IS AN ARDUOUS CONTRIVANCE ONLY TO BE ACHIEVED IN FORTUNATE MOMENTS FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
460-172357-0018.flac,IN REGARD TO THE PRESENT WORK I MUST DISCLAIM AT ONCE ALL INTENTIONS OF TRYING TO DO ANYTHING SO RIDICULOUSLY EASY AS WRITING ABOUT A REAL PLACE AND REAL PEOPLE MARIPOSA IS NOT A REAL TOWN ON THE CONTRARY IT IS ABOUT SEVENTY OR EIGHTY OF THEM
460-172357-0019.flac,YOU MAY FIND THEM ALL THE WAY FROM LAKE SUPERIOR TO THE SEA WITH THE SAME SQUARE STREETS AND THE SAME MAPLE TREES AND THE SAME CHURCHES AND HOTELS AND EVERYWHERE THE SUNSHINE OF THE LAND OF HOPE SIMILARLY THE REVEREND MISTER DRONE IS NOT ONE PERSON BUT ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN
460-172357-0020.flac,TO MAKE HIM I CLAPPED THE GAITERS OF ONE ECCLESIASTIC ROUND THE LEGS OF ANOTHER ADDED THE SERMONS OF A THIRD AND THE CHARACTER OF A FOURTH AND SO LET HIM START ON HIS WAY IN THE BOOK TO PICK UP SUCH INDIVIDUAL ATTRIBUTES AS HE MIGHT FIND FOR HIMSELF
460-172357-0021.flac,MULLINS AND BAGSHAW AND JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH AND THE REST ARE IT IS TRUE PERSONAL FRIENDS OF MINE BUT I HAVE KNOWN THEM IN SUCH A VARIETY OF FORMS WITH SUCH ALTERNATIONS OF TALL AND SHORT DARK AND FAIR THAT INDIVIDUALLY I SHOULD HAVE MUCH ADO TO KNOW THEM
460-172357-0022.flac,AND NEEDS A TELLER AS FOR MISTER SMITH WITH HIS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY POUNDS HIS HOARSE VOICE HIS LOUD CHECK SUIT
460-172357-0023.flac,ALL OF THIS IS KNOWN BY EVERYBODY TO BE A NECESSARY AND UNIVERSAL ADJUNCT OF THE HOTEL BUSINESS THE INSPIRATION OF THE BOOK
460-172357-0024.flac,A LAND OF HOPE AND SUNSHINE WHERE LITTLE TOWNS SPREAD THEIR SQUARE STREETS AND THEIR TRIM MAPLE TREES BESIDE PLACID LAKES ALMOST WITHIN ECHO OF THE PRIMEVAL FOREST IS LARGE ENOUGH
460-172357-0025.flac,THE FAULT LIES RATHER WITH AN ART THAT IS DEFICIENT THAN IN AN AFFECTION THAT IS WANTING
8630-305212-0000.flac,CHAPTER FIVE HOW AUGUSTINE WENT TO CARTHAGE AND HOW PATRICIUS DIED A CHRISTIAN DEATH AUGUSTINE'S YEAR AT HOME DID NOT DO FOR HIM WHAT MONICA HAD HOPED
8630-305212-0001.flac,HIS OLD PAGAN SCHOOLFELLOWS GATHERED ROUND HIM HE WAS ALWAYS WITH THEM THE HAPPY HOME LIFE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST ITS CHARM THE WANT OF PRINCIPLE AND OF HONOUR IN MOST OF THEM
8630-305212-0002.flac,DISGUSTED HIM IN HIS BETTER MOMENTS NEVERTHELESS HE WAS CONTENT TO ENJOY HIMSELF IN THEIR COMPANY HE WAS EVEN ASHAMED WHEN THEY BOASTED OF THEIR MISDOINGS TO SEEM MORE INNOCENT THAN THEY
8630-305212-0003.flac,AND WOULD PRETEND TO BE WORSE THAN HE REALLY WAS LEST HIS PRESTIGE SHOULD SUFFER IN THEIR EYES THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN HE LOATHED IT ALL AND LONGED FOR THE OLD LIFE WITH ITS INNOCENT PLEASURES
8630-305212-0004.flac,BUT IT IS HARD TO TURN BACK ON THE DOWNHILL ROAD HE TELLS US HOW HE WENT ONE NIGHT WITH A BAND OF THESE WILD COMPANIONS TO ROB THE FRUIT TREE OF A POOR NEIGHBOUR IT WAS LADEN WITH PEARS
8630-305212-0005.flac,BUT THEY WERE NOT VERY GOOD THEY DID NOT CARE TO EAT THEM AND THREW THEM TO THE PIGS IT WAS NOT SCHOOLBOY GREED THAT PROMPTED THE THEFT BUT THE PURE DELIGHT OF DOING EVIL
8630-305212-0006.flac,OF TRICKING THE OWNER OF THE GARDEN THERE WAS THE WILD EXCITEMENT TOO OF THE DARING THE FEAR THAT THEY MIGHT BE CAUGHT IN THE ACT HE WAS CAREFUL TO KEEP SUCH ESCAPADES A SECRET FROM HIS MOTHER BUT MONICA WAS UNEASY
8630-305212-0007.flac,KNOWING WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM THE COMPANIONS HER SON HAD CHOSEN PATRICIUS WAS ALTOGETHER UNABLE TO GIVE AUGUSTINE THE HELP THAT HE NEEDED THE CHRISTIAN IDEALS OF LIFE AND CONDUCT WERE NEW TO HIM AS YET
8630-305212-0008.flac,THE OLD PAGAN WAYS SEEMED ONLY NATURAL HE WAS SCARCELY LIKELY TO BE ASTONISHED AT THE FACT THAT HIS SON'S BOYHOOD WAS RATHER LIKE WHAT HIS OWN HAD BEEN HE WAS STANDING IT IS TRUE ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE CHURCH
8630-305212-0009.flac,BUT HER TEACHING WAS NOT YET CLEAR TO HIM HIS OWN FEET WERE NOT FIRM ENOUGH IN THE WAYS OF CHRIST TO ENABLE HIM TO STRETCH A STEADYING HAND TO ANOTHER HIS MOTHER WAS FAILING FAST
8630-305212-0010.flac,THE END COULD NOT BE FAR OFF MONICA WAS DEVOTING HERSELF HEART AND SOUL TO THE OLD WOMAN WHO CLUNG TO HER WITH TENDER AFFECTION AND WAS NEVER HAPPY IN HER ABSENCE PATRICIUS WATCHED THEM TOGETHER
8630-305212-0011.flac,AND MARVELLED AT THE EFFECTS OF THE GRACE OF BAPTISM WAS THAT INDEED HIS MOTHER HE ASKED HIMSELF THAT GENTLE PATIENT OLD WOMAN SO THOUGHTFUL FOR OTHERS SO READY TO GIVE UP HER OWN WILL
8630-305212-0012.flac,SHE HAD USED TO BE VIOLENT AND HEADSTRONG LIKE HIMSELF RESENTFUL AND IMPLACABLE IN HER DISLIKES BUT NOW SHE WAS MORE LIKE MONICA THAN LIKE HIM THAT WAS MONICA'S WAY THOUGH HER SWEETNESS AND PATIENCE
8630-305212-0013.flac,SEEMED TO BE CATCHING SHE WAS LIKE THE SUNSHINE PENETRATING EVERYWHERE WITH ITS LIGHT AND WARMTH HE ALAS WAS FAR BEHIND HIS MOTHER CATECHUMEN THOUGH HE WAS THE OLD TEMPER WOULD OFTEN FLASH OUT STILL
8630-305212-0014.flac,SELF CONQUEST WAS THE HARDEST TASK THAT HE HAD EVER UNDERTAKEN AND SOMETIMES HE ALMOST LOST HEART AND WAS INCLINED TO GIVE IT UP ALTOGETHER THEN MONICA WOULD GENTLY REMIND HIM
8630-305212-0015.flac,THAT WITH GOD'S HELP THE HARDEST THINGS WERE POSSIBLE AND THEY WOULD KNEEL AND PRAY TOGETHER AND PATRICIUS WOULD TAKE HEART AGAIN FOR THE FIGHT SHE HAD A WONDERFUL GIFT FOR GIVING PEOPLE COURAGE PATRICIUS HAD NOTICED THAT BEFORE
8630-305212-0016.flac,HE SUPPOSED IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS SO FULL OF SYMPATHY AND ALWAYS MADE ALLOWANCES AND THEN SHE SEEMED TO THINK TO BE SURE EVEN THAT IF ONE WENT ON TRYING FAILURES DID NOT MATTER
8630-305212-0017.flac,GOD DID NOT MIND THEM AND THAT WAS A VERY COMFORTING REFLECTION FOR POOR WEAK PEOPLE LIKE HIMSELF TO GO ON TRYING WAS POSSIBLE EVEN FOR HIM ALTHOUGH HE KNEW HE COULD NOT ALWAYS PROMISE HIMSELF SUCCESS
8630-305212-0018.flac,PATRICIUS WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT AUGUSTINE'S FUTURE ALL HIS EFFORTS HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN SAVING THE SUM REQUIRED FOR HIS FIRST YEAR AT CARTHAGE
8630-305212-0019.flac,HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT IT WOULD COST A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN HE HAD AT FIRST SUPPOSED AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHERE THE MONEY WAS TO COME FROM IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT ROMANIANUS
8630-305212-0020.flac,WHO KNEW THE POVERTY OF HIS FRIEND CAME FORWARD GENEROUSLY AND PUT HIS PURSE AT PATRICIUS'S DISPOSAL THE SUM REQUIRED WAS OFFERED WITH SUCH DELICACY THAT IT COULD NOT BE DECLINED AUGUSTINE WAS SURE TO BRING GLORY ON HIS NATIVE TOWN
8630-305212-0021.flac,SAID ROMANIANUS IT WAS AN HONOUR TO BE ALLOWED TO HELP IN HIS EDUCATION MONICA WAS ALMOST GLAD TO SEE HER SON DEPART THE OLD BOYISH LAZINESS HAD GIVEN WAY
8630-305212-0022.flac,TO A REAL ZEAL FOR LEARNING AND THIRST AFTER KNOWLEDGE THE IDLE LIFE AT HOME WAS CERTAINLY THE WORST THING FOR HIM HARD WORK AND THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM MIGHT STEADY HIS WILD NATURE AND BRING HIM BACK TO GOD
8630-305212-0023.flac,IT WAS HER ONLY HOPE NOW AS WITH PRAYERS AND TEARS SHE BESOUGHT OF HIM TO WATCH OVER HER SON BUT MONICA DID NOT KNOW CARTHAGE
8630-305212-0024.flac,IF IT WAS SECOND ONLY TO ROME FOR ITS CULTURE AND ITS SCHOOLS IT ALMOST RIVALLED ROME IN ITS CORRUPTION THERE ALL THAT WAS WORST IN THE CIVILIZATION OF THE EAST AND OF THE WEST MET AND MINGLED

8630-305212-0026.flac,IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE WERE ACTED IN THE THEATRE THE HORRIBLE RITES OF THE EASTERN RELIGIONS WERE PRACTISED OPENLY THERE WAS NEITHER DISCIPLINE NOR ORDER IN THE SCHOOLS
8630-305212-0027.flac,THE WEALTHIER STUDENTS GLORIED IN THEIR BAD REPUTATION THEY WERE YOUNG MEN OF FASHION WHO WERE CAPABLE OF ANYTHING AND WHO WERE CAREFUL TO LET OTHERS KNOW IT THEY WENT BY THE NAME OF SMASHERS OR UPSETTERS
8630-305212-0028.flac,FROM THEIR HABIT OF RAIDING THE SCHOOLS OF PROFESSORS WHOSE TEACHING THEY DID NOT APPROVE AND BREAKING EVERYTHING ON WHICH THEY COULD LAY HANDS THEY TREATED NEW COMERS WITH COARSE BRUTALITY BUT AUGUSTINE SEEMS IN SOME MANNER
8630-305212-0029.flac,TO HAVE ESCAPED THEIR ENMITY PERHAPS A CERTAIN DIGNITY IN THE YOUNG MAN'S BEARING OR PERHAPS HIS BRILLIANT GIFTS WON THEIR RESPECT FOR HE SURPASSED THEM ALL IN INTELLIGENCE AND SPEEDILY OUTSTRIPPED THEM IN CLASS
8630-305212-0030.flac,AUGUSTINE WAS EAGER FOR KNOWLEDGE AND EAGER FOR ENJOYMENT HE FREQUENTED THE THEATRE HIS PLEASURE LOVING NATURE SNATCHED AT EVERYTHING THAT LIFE COULD GIVE YET HE WAS NOT HAPPY

8630-305212-0032.flac,PATRICIUS PRAYED WITH HER HE UNDERSTOOD AT LAST EVERY DAY THE GERMS OF A NOBLE NATURE THAT HAD LAIN SO LONG DORMANT WITHIN HIM WERE GAINING STRENGTH AND LIFE
8630-305212-0033.flac,EVERY DAY HIS SOUL WAS OPENING MORE AND MORE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF SPIRITUAL THINGS WHILE MONICA WATCHED THE TRANSFORMATION WITH A HEART THAT OVERFLOWED WITH GRATITUDE AND LOVE
8630-305212-0034.flac,THE SORROWS OF THE PAST WERE ALL FORGOTTEN IN THE JOY OF THE PRESENT THAT HAPPY UNION AT THE FEET OF CHRIST THERE WAS BUT ONE CAUSE FOR SADNESS PATRICIUS'S HEALTH WAS FAILING
8630-305212-0035.flac,HIS MOTHER HAD ALREADY SHOWN HIM THE JOYS OF A CHRISTIAN DEATHBED SHE HAD PASSED AWAY SMILING WITH THEIR HANDS IN HERS AND THE NAME OF JESUS ON HER LIPS
8630-305212-0036.flac,THE BEAUTIFUL PRAYERS OF THE CHURCH HAD GONE DOWN WITH THE DEPARTING SOUL TO THE THRESHOLD OF THE NEW LIFE AND HAD FOLLOWED IT INTO ETERNITY SHE SEEMED CLOSE TO THEM STILL IN THE LIGHT OF THAT WONDERFUL NEW FAITH

8630-305212-0044.flac,SPOKE WORDS OF HOPE AND COMFORT ON THE THRESHOLD OF THAT OTHER WORLD MONICA BADE FAREWELL TO HER HUSBAND
8630-305213-0000.flac,CHAPTER SIX HOW SAINT MONICA LIVED IN THE DAYS OF HER WIDOWHOOD AND HOW SHE PUT ALL HER TRUST IN GOD PATRICIUS HAD NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF WORLDLY GOODS TO LEAVE TO HIS WIFE
8630-305213-0001.flac,SHE NEEDED LITTLE IT IS TRUE FOR HERSELF BUT THERE WAS AUGUSTINE WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR HER EVEN IF SHE PRACTISED THE STRICTEST ECONOMY TO KEEP HIM AT CARTHAGE WHERE HE WAS DOING SO WELL
8630-305213-0002.flac,ROMANIANUS DIVINED HER ANXIETY AND HASTENED TO SET IT AT REST HE HAD A HOUSE IN CARTHAGE HE SAID IT SHOULD BE AUGUSTINE'S AS LONG AS HE REQUIRED IT
8630-305213-0003.flac,THIS WOULD SETTLE THE QUESTION OF LODGING FOR THE REST CONTINUED ROMANIANUS AS AN OLD FRIEND OF PATRICIUS HE HAD THE RIGHT TO BEFRIEND HIS SON AND MONICA MUST GRANT HIM THE PRIVILEGE
8630-305213-0004.flac,OF ACTING A FATHER'S PART TO AUGUSTINE UNTIL HE WAS FAIRLY LAUNCHED IN LIFE HE HAD A CHILD OF HIS OWN
8630-305213-0005.flac,IF MONICA WOULD BEFRIEND HIS BOY THEY WOULD BE QUITS THE GRATITUDE OF BOTH MOTHER AND SON TOWARDS THIS GENEROUS FRIEND AND BENEFACTOR LASTED THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES
8630-305213-0006.flac,YOU IT WAS ROMANIANUS WROTE AUGUSTINE IN HIS CONFESSIONS WHO WHEN I WAS A POOR YOUNG STUDENT IN CARTHAGE OPENED TO ME YOUR HOUSE YOUR PURSE AND STILL MORE YOUR HEART
8630-305213-0007.flac,YOU IT WAS WHO WHEN I HAD THE SORROW TO LOSE MY FATHER COMFORTED ME BY YOUR FRIENDSHIP HELPED ME WITH YOUR ADVICE AND ASSISTED ME WITH YOUR FORTUNE
8630-305213-0008.flac,MONICA MOURNED HER HUSBAND'S DEATH WITH TRUE DEVOTION BUT HERS WAS NOT A SELFISH SORROW SHE HAD LOVE AND SYMPATHY FOR ALL WHO NEEDED THEM
8630-305213-0009.flac,AND FORGOT HER OWN GRIEF IN SOLACING THAT OF OTHERS THERE WERE CERTAIN GOOD WORKS WHICH THE CHURCH GAVE TO CHRISTIAN WIDOWS TO PERFORM THE HOSPITALS FOR INSTANCE WERE ENTIRELY IN THEIR HANDS
8630-305213-0010.flac,THEY WERE SMALL AS YET BUILT ACCORDING TO THE NEEDS OF THE MOMENT FROM THE FUNDS OF THE FAITHFUL AND HELD BUT FEW PATIENTS THESE DEVOTED WOMEN SUCCEEDED EACH OTHER AT INTERVALS
8630-305213-0011.flac,IN THEIR TASK OF WASHING AND ATTENDING TO THE SICK WATCHING BY THEIR BEDS AND CLEANING THEIR ROOMS THEIR MINISTRATIONS DID NOT EVEN CEASE THERE WITH REVERENT CARE THEY PREPARED THE DEAD FOR BURIAL
8630-305213-0012.flac,THINKING THE WHILE OF THE PREPARATION OF CHRIST'S BODY FOR THE TOMB AND OF HIM WHO SAID INASMUCH AS YE DO IT TO THE LEAST OF MY BRETHREN YE DO IT UNTO ME
8630-305213-0013.flac,IT WAS A HAPPY MOMENT FOR MONICA WHEN HER TURN CAME TO SERVE THE SICK SHE WOULD KISS THEIR SORES FOR VERY PITY AS SHE WASHED AND DRESSED THEM AND THEIR FACES GREW BRIGHT AT HER COMING
8630-305213-0014.flac,THEY CALLED HER MOTHER IT SEEMED SUCH A NATURAL NAME TO GIVE HER FOR SHE WAS A MOTHER TO THEM ALL AND GAVE THEM A MOTHER'S LOVE TO SOME OF THE POOR CREATURES FRIENDLESS SLAVES AS THEY OFTEN WERE
8630-305213-0015.flac,WHO HAD KNOWN LITTLE SYMPATHY OR TENDERNESS IN THEIR HARD LIVES IT WAS A REVELATION OF CHRISTIANITY WHICH TAUGHT THEM MORE THAN HOURS OF PREACHING COULD HAVE DONE BUT THERE WAS OTHER WORK BESIDES THAT AT THE HOSPITAL
8630-305213-0016.flac,THERE WERE THE POOR TO BE HELPED THE HUNGRY TO BE FED THE NAKED TO BE CLOTHED SHE WOULD GATHER THE ORPHAN CHILDREN AT HER KNEE TO TEACH THEM THE TRUTHS OF THEIR FAITH WHEN THEY WERE VERY POOR
8630-305213-0017.flac,SHE WOULD KEEP THEM IN HER OWN HOUSE FEED THEM AT HER OWN TABLE AND CLOTHE THEM WITH HER OWN HANDS IF I AM A MOTHER TO THESE MOTHERLESS ONES SHE WOULD SAY TO HERSELF HE WILL HAVE MERCY AND GIVE ME BACK MY BOY
8630-305213-0018.flac,IF I TEACH THEM TO KNOW AND LOVE HIM AS A FATHER HE WILL WATCH OVER MY SON IT WAS A CUSTOM OF THE TIME ON THE FEASTS OF SAINTS AND MARTYRS TO MAKE A PILGRIMAGE TO THEIR TOMBS
8630-305213-0019.flac,WITH A LITTLE BASKET OF FOOD AND WINE THIS WAS LAID ON THE GRAVE AFTER WHICH THE FAITHFUL WOULD PARTAKE OF WHAT THEY HAD BROUGHT WHILE THEY THOUGHT AND SPOKE OF THE NOBLE LIVES OF GOD'S SERVANTS WHO HAD GONE BEFORE
8630-305213-0020.flac,THE CUSTOM WAS ABOLISHED NOT LONG AFTER ON ACCOUNT OF THE ABUSES WHICH HAD ARISEN BUT MONICA OBSERVED IT TO THE END SHE SCARCELY TASTED OF HER OFFERING HERSELF
8630-305213-0021.flac,BUT GAVE IT ALL AWAY TO THE POOR OFTEN INDEED SHE WENT COLD AND HUNGRY THAT THEY MIGHT BE CLOTHED AND FED HER LOVE OF PRAYER TOO COULD NOW FIND FULL SCOPE
8630-305213-0022.flac,EVERY MORNING FOUND HER IN HER PLACE IN CHURCH FOR THE HOLY SACRIFICE EVERY EVENING SHE WAS THERE AGAIN SILENT ABSORBED IN GOD THE PLACE WHERE SHE KNELT WAS OFTEN WET WITH HER TEARS
8630-305213-0023.flac,THE TIME PASSED BY UNHEEDED PATRICIUS HER HUSBAND WAS SAFE IN GOD'S HANDS BUT AUGUSTINE HER ELDEST BORN HER DARLING IN WHAT DARK PATHS WAS HE WANDERING
8630-305213-0024.flac,AND YET IN HER HEART OF HEARTS THERE WAS A DEEP CONVICTION THAT NO SAD NEWS OF HIS LIFE AT CARTHAGE COULD SHAKE HIS WAS NOT THE NATURE TO FIND CONTENTMENT IN THE THINGS OF EARTH
8630-305213-0025.flac,HE WAS BORN TO SOMETHING HIGHER HIS NOBLE HEART HIS STRONG INTELLIGENCE WOULD BRING HIM BACK TO GOD AND YET AND YET
8630-305213-0026.flac,HER HEART SANK AS SHE THOUGHT OF GRACES WASTED OF CONSCIENCE TRAMPLED UNDERFOOT OF LIGHT REJECTED NO THERE WAS NO HOPE ANYWHERE BUT WITH GOD IN HIM SHE WOULD TRUST AND IN HIM ALONE
8630-305213-0027.flac,HE WAS INFINITE IN MERCY AND STRONG TO SAVE HE HAD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD NEVER FAIL THOSE WHO PUT THEIR TRUST IN HIM AT HIS FEET AND AT HIS FEET ALONE
8630-305213-0028.flac,MONICA POURED OUT HER TEARS AND HER SORROW WITH OTHERS SHE WAS SERENE AND HOPEFUL AS OF OLD EVEN JOYOUS ALWAYS READY TO HELP AND COMFORT IT WAS SAID OF HER AFTER HER DEATH
8630-305213-0029.flac,THAT NO ONE HAD SUCH A GIFT OF HELPING OTHERS AS SHE SHE NEVER PREACHED AT PEOPLE MOST PEOPLE HAVE AN INSURMOUNTABLE DISLIKE TO BEING PREACHED AT BUT EVERY WORD SHE SAID HAD A STRANGE POWER OF DRAWING SOULS TO GOD
8630-305213-0030.flac,OF MAKING THEM WISH TO BE BETTER AUGUSTINE MEANWHILE AT CARTHAGE WAS JUSTIFYING ALL THE HOPES THAT HAD BEEN FORMED OF HIM HE HAD EVEN GREATER GIFTS IT SEEMED THAN ELOQUENCE FEELING AND WIT
8630-305213-0031.flac,HE WAS AT THE HEAD OF HIS CLASS IN RHETORIC HIS MASTER HAD SPOKEN TO HIM OF A CERTAIN TREATISE OF ARISTOTLE WHICH HE WOULD SOON BE CALLED UPON TO STUDY IT WAS SO PROFOUND HE SAID THAT FEW COULD UNDERSTAND IT
8630-305213-0032.flac,EVEN WITH THE HELP OF THE MOST LEARNED PROFESSORS AUGUSTINE EAGER TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS WONDERFUL WORK PROCURED IT AT ONCE AND READ IT IT SEEMED TO HIM PERFECTLY SIMPLE IT WAS UNNECESSARY HE FOUND
8630-305213-0033.flac,TO ASK A SINGLE EXPLANATION IT WAS THE SAME WITH GEOMETRY MUSIC EVERY SCIENCE HE TOOK UP THIS YOUNG GENIUS OF NINETEEN ONLY DISCOVERED THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY
8630-305213-0034.flac,WHEN HE HAD TO TEACH OTHERS AND REALIZED HOW HARD IT WAS TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS SO EXCEEDINGLY SIMPLE TO HIMSELF THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGELY SYMPATHETIC AND ATTRACTIVE ABOUT AUGUSTINE
8630-305213-0035.flac,HE SEEMED MODEST AND RESERVED ABOUT HIS OWN GIFTS ALTHOUGH HE HIMSELF TELLS US IN HIS CONFESSIONS THAT HE WAS FULL OF PRIDE AND AMBITION HE HAD A GIFT OF MAKING TRUE AND FAITHFUL FRIENDS A CHARM IN CONVERSATION
8630-305213-0036.flac,THAT DREW HIS YOUNG COMPANIONS AND EVEN OLDER MEN TO HIS SIDE A MORE WORLDLY MOTHER THAN MONICA WOULD HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY PROUD OF HER SON FAITH AND VIRTUE WERE ALONE WEAK AND FAINT IN THAT SOUL
8630-305213-0037.flac,THAT COULD SO ILL DO WITHOUT THEM BUT TO HER THEY WERE THE ONE ESSENTIAL THING THE REST DID NOT MATTER YET MONICA WITH TRUE INSIGHT BELIEVED THAT WITH NOBLE MINDS KNOWLEDGE MUST DRAW MEN TO GOD
8630-305213-0038.flac,SHE HOPED MUCH THEREFORE THAT AUGUSTINE'S BRILLIANCE OF INTELLECT WOULD SAVE HIM IN THE END AND HER HOPES WERE NOT DECEIVED ALREADY THE NOBLE PHILOSOPHY OF CICERO
8630-305213-0039.flac,PAGAN THOUGH HE WAS HAD AWAKENED A THIRST FOR WISDOM IN THE YOUNG STUDENT'S SOUL ALREADY HE FELT THE EMPTINESS OF EARTHLY JOYS I LONGED MY GOD HE WRITES
8630-305213-0040.flac,AND I KNEW NOT THAT IT WAS THOU THAT WAST WORKING IN ME ONE THING COOLED MY ARDOUR HE GOES ON TO SAY IT WAS THAT THE NAME OF CHRIST WAS NOT THERE AND THIS NAME BY THY MERCY LORD
8630-305213-0041.flac,OF THY SON MY SAVIOUR MY HEART HAD DRAWN IN WITH MY MOTHER'S MILK AND KEPT IN ITS DEPTHS AND EVERY DOCTRINE WHERE THIS NAME DID NOT APPEAR FLUENT ELEGANT AND TRUTH LIKE THOUGH IT MIGHT BE
8630-305213-0042.flac,COULD NOT MASTER ME ALTOGETHER HE THEN TURNED TO THE HOLY SCRIPTURES BUT THEY APPEARED TO HIM INFERIOR IN STYLE TO CICERO MY PRIDE HE WRITES
8630-305213-0043.flac,DESPISED THE MANNER IN WHICH THE THINGS ARE SAID AND MY INTELLIGENCE COULD NOT DISCOVER THE HIDDEN SENSE
8630-305213-0044.flac,AND I DISDAINED TO HUMBLE MYSELF AND INFLATED WITH VAINGLORY I BELIEVED MYSELF GREAT IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT HE CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE MANICHEANS WHOSE ERRORS ATTRACTED HIM AT ONCE
8630-305213-0045.flac,THIS EXTRAORDINARY HERESY HAD BEGUN IN THE EAST AND HAD SPREAD ALL OVER THE CIVILIZED WORLD ITS FOLLOWERS FORMED A SECRET SOCIETY WITH SIGNS AND PASSWORDS GRADES AND INITIATIONS
8630-305213-0046.flac,TO IMPOSE ON CHRISTIANS THEY USED CHRISTIAN WORDS FOR DOCTRINES THAT WERE THOROUGHLY UNCHRISTIAN PERHAPS THE MOST REMARKABLE THING ABOUT THEM WAS THEIR HATRED OF THE CHURCH AUGUSTINE
8630-305213-0047.flac,WHO REMAINED AMONGST THEM FOR NINE YEARS THUS DESCRIBES THEM WHEN WRITING TO A FRIEND THOU KNOWEST HONORATUS THAT FOR THIS REASON ALONE DID WE FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THESE MEN
8630-305213-0048.flac,NAMELY THAT THEY PROFESSED TO FREE US FROM ALL ERRORS AND BRING US TO GOD BY PURE REASON ALONE WITHOUT THAT TERRIBLE PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORITY FOR WHAT ELSE INDUCED ME TO ABANDON THE FAITH OF MY CHILDHOOD
8630-305213-0049.flac,AND FOLLOW THESE MEN FOR ALMOST NINE YEARS BUT THEIR ASSERTION THAT WE WERE TERRIFIED BY SUPERSTITION INTO A FAITH BLINDLY IMPOSED UPON OUR REASON WHILE THEY URGED NO ONE TO BELIEVE
8630-305213-0050.flac,UNTIL THE TRUTH WAS FULLY DISCUSSED AND PROVED WHO WOULD NOT BE SEDUCED BY SUCH PROMISES ESPECIALLY IF HE WERE A PROUD CONTENTIOUS YOUNG MAN THIRSTING FOR TRUTH SUCH AS THEY THEN FOUND ME
8630-305213-0051.flac,THAT WAS WHAT THE MANICHEANS PROMISED WHAT AUGUSTINE FOUND AMONGST THEM HE ALSO TELLS US THEY INCESSANTLY REPEATED TO ME TRUTH TRUTH BUT THERE WAS NO TRUTH IN THEM
8630-305213-0052.flac,THEY TAUGHT WHAT WAS FALSE NOT ONLY ABOUT THEE MY GOD WHO ART THE VERY TRUTH BUT EVEN ABOUT THE ELEMENTS OF THIS WORLD THY CREATURES SO MUCH FOR THEIR DOCTRINES AS FOR THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES
8630-305213-0053.flac,HE FOUND THEM CARNAL AND LOQUACIOUS FULL OF INSANE PRIDE THE GREAT CHARM OF MANICHEISM TO AUGUSTINE WAS THAT IT TAUGHT THAT A MAN WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS SINS THIS DOCTRINE WAS CONVENIENT TO ONE
8630-305213-0054.flac,WHO COULD NOT FIND THE STRENGTH TO BREAK WITH HIS BAD HABITS SUCH WAS MY MIND HE SUMS UP LATER LOOKING BACK ON THIS PERIOD OF HIS LIFE SO WEIGHED DOWN SO BLINDED BY THE FLESH
103-1240-0000.flac,CHAPTER ONE MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE IS SURPRISED MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE LIVED JUST WHERE THE AVONLEA MAIN ROAD DIPPED DOWN INTO A LITTLE HOLLOW FRINGED WITH ALDERS AND LADIES EARDROPS AND TRAVERSED BY A BROOK
103-1240-0001.flac,THAT HAD ITS SOURCE AWAY BACK IN THE WOODS OF THE OLD CUTHBERT PLACE IT WAS REPUTED TO BE AN INTRICATE HEADLONG BROOK IN ITS EARLIER COURSE THROUGH THOSE WOODS WITH DARK SECRETS OF POOL AND CASCADE BUT BY THE TIME IT REACHED LYNDE'S HOLLOW IT WAS A QUIET WELL CONDUCTED LITTLE STREAM
103-1240-0002.flac,FOR NOT EVEN A BROOK COULD RUN PAST MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE'S DOOR WITHOUT DUE REGARD FOR DECENCY AND DECORUM IT PROBABLY WAS CONSCIOUS THAT MISSUS RACHEL WAS SITTING AT HER WINDOW KEEPING A SHARP EYE ON EVERYTHING THAT PASSED FROM BROOKS AND CHILDREN UP
103-1240-0003.flac,AND THAT IF SHE NOTICED ANYTHING ODD OR OUT OF PLACE SHE WOULD NEVER REST UNTIL SHE HAD FERRETED OUT THE WHYS AND WHEREFORES THEREOF THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE IN AVONLEA AND OUT OF IT WHO CAN ATTEND CLOSELY TO THEIR NEIGHBOR'S BUSINESS BY DINT OF NEGLECTING THEIR OWN
103-1240-0004.flac,BUT MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE WAS ONE OF THOSE CAPABLE CREATURES WHO CAN MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS AND THOSE OF OTHER FOLKS INTO THE BARGAIN SHE WAS A NOTABLE HOUSEWIFE HER WORK WAS ALWAYS DONE AND WELL DONE SHE RAN THE SEWING CIRCLE
103-1240-0005.flac,HELPED RUN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL AND WAS THE STRONGEST PROP OF THE CHURCH AID SOCIETY AND FOREIGN MISSIONS AUXILIARY YET WITH ALL THIS MISSUS RACHEL FOUND ABUNDANT TIME TO SIT FOR HOURS AT HER KITCHEN WINDOW KNITTING COTTON WARP QUILTS SHE HAD KNITTED SIXTEEN OF THEM
103-1240-0006.flac,AS AVONLEA HOUSEKEEPERS WERE WONT TO TELL IN AWED VOICES AND KEEPING A SHARP EYE ON THE MAIN ROAD THAT CROSSED THE HOLLOW AND WOUND UP THE STEEP RED HILL BEYOND
103-1240-0007.flac,ANYBODY WHO WENT OUT OF IT OR INTO IT HAD TO PASS OVER THAT HILL ROAD AND SO RUN THE UNSEEN GAUNTLET OF MISSUS RACHEL'S ALL SEEING EYE SHE WAS SITTING THERE ONE AFTERNOON IN EARLY JUNE THE SUN WAS COMING IN AT THE WINDOW WARM AND BRIGHT
103-1240-0008.flac,THE ORCHARD ON THE SLOPE BELOW THE HOUSE WAS IN A BRIDAL FLUSH OF PINKY WHITE BLOOM HUMMED OVER BY A MYRIAD OF BEES THOMAS LYNDE A MEEK LITTLE MAN WHOM AVONLEA PEOPLE CALLED RACHEL LYNDE'S HUSBAND WAS SOWING HIS LATE TURNIP SEED ON THE HILL FIELD BEYOND THE BARN
103-1240-0009.flac,MISSUS RACHEL KNEW THAT HE OUGHT BECAUSE SHE HAD HEARD HIM TELL PETER MORRISON THE EVENING BEFORE IN WILLIAM J BLAIR'S STORE OVER AT CARMODY THAT HE MEANT TO SOW HIS TURNIP SEED THE NEXT AFTERNOON
103-1240-0010.flac,PETER HAD ASKED HIM OF COURSE FOR MATTHEW CUTHBERT HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO VOLUNTEER INFORMATION ABOUT ANYTHING IN HIS WHOLE LIFE AND YET HERE WAS MATTHEW CUTHBERT AT HALF PAST THREE ON THE AFTERNOON OF A BUSY DAY PLACIDLY DRIVING OVER THE HOLLOW AND UP THE HILL
103-1240-0011.flac,AND HIS BEST SUIT OF CLOTHES WHICH WAS PLAIN PROOF THAT HE WAS GOING OUT OF AVONLEA AND HE HAD THE BUGGY AND THE SORREL MARE WHICH BETOKENED THAT HE WAS GOING A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE NOW WHERE WAS MATTHEW CUTHBERT GOING AND WHY WAS HE GOING THERE
103-1240-0012.flac,HAD IT BEEN ANY OTHER MAN IN AVONLEA MISSUS RACHEL DEFTLY PUTTING THIS AND THAT TOGETHER MIGHT HAVE GIVEN A PRETTY GOOD GUESS AS TO BOTH QUESTIONS BUT MATTHEW SO RARELY WENT FROM HOME THAT IT MUST BE SOMETHING PRESSING AND UNUSUAL WHICH WAS TAKING HIM
103-1240-0013.flac,HE WAS THE SHYEST MAN ALIVE AND HATED TO HAVE TO GO AMONG STRANGERS OR TO ANY PLACE WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE TO TALK MATTHEW DRESSED UP WITH A WHITE COLLAR AND DRIVING IN A BUGGY WAS SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN OFTEN MISSUS RACHEL PONDER AS SHE MIGHT COULD MAKE NOTHING OF IT
103-1240-0014.flac,AND HER AFTERNOON'S ENJOYMENT WAS SPOILED I'LL JUST STEP OVER TO GREEN GABLES AFTER TEA AND FIND OUT FROM MARILLA WHERE HE'S GONE AND WHY THE WORTHY WOMAN FINALLY CONCLUDED HE DOESN'T GENERALLY GO TO TOWN THIS TIME OF YEAR AND HE NEVER VISITS
103-1240-0015.flac,IF HE'D RUN OUT OF TURNIP SEED HE WOULDN'T DRESS UP AND TAKE THE BUGGY TO GO FOR MORE
103-1240-0016.flac,YET SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED SINCE LAST NIGHT TO START HIM OFF I'M CLEAN PUZZLED THAT'S WHAT AND I WON'T KNOW A MINUTE'S PEACE OF MIND OR CONSCIENCE UNTIL I KNOW WHAT HAS TAKEN MATTHEW CUTHBERT OUT OF AVONLEA TODAY ACCORDINGLY AFTER TEA MISSUS RACHEL SET OUT SHE HAD NOT FAR TO GO
103-1240-0017.flac,THE BIG RAMBLING ORCHARD EMBOWERED HOUSE WHERE THE CUTHBERTS LIVED WAS A SCANT QUARTER OF A MILE UP THE ROAD FROM LYNDE'S HOLLOW TO BE SURE THE LONG LANE MADE IT A GOOD DEAL FURTHER MATTHEW CUTHBERT'S FATHER AS SHY AND SILENT AS HIS SON AFTER HIM
103-1240-0018.flac,HAD GOT AS FAR AWAY AS HE POSSIBLY COULD FROM HIS FELLOW MEN WITHOUT ACTUALLY RETREATING INTO THE WOODS WHEN HE FOUNDED HIS HOMESTEAD GREEN GABLES WAS BUILT AT THE FURTHEST EDGE OF HIS CLEARED LAND AND THERE IT WAS TO THIS DAY
103-1240-0019.flac,BARELY VISIBLE FROM THE MAIN ROAD ALONG WHICH ALL THE OTHER AVONLEA HOUSES WERE SO SOCIABLY SITUATED MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE DID NOT CALL LIVING IN SUCH A PLACE LIVING AT ALL IT'S JUST STAYING THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID AS SHE STEPPED ALONG THE DEEP RUTTED GRASSY LANE
103-1240-0020.flac,BORDERED WITH WILD ROSE BUSHES IT'S NO WONDER MATTHEW AND MARILLA ARE BOTH A LITTLE ODD LIVING AWAY BACK HERE BY THEMSELVES TREES AREN'T MUCH COMPANY THOUGH DEAR KNOWS IF THEY WERE THERE'D BE ENOUGH OF THEM I'D RUTHER LOOK AT PEOPLE TO BE SURE

103-1240-0022.flac,SET ABOUT ON ONE SIDE WITH GREAT PATRIARCHAL WILLOWS AND THE OTHER WITH PRIM LOMBARDIES NOT A STRAY STICK NOR STONE WAS TO BE SEEN FOR MISSUS RACHEL WOULD HAVE SEEN IT IF THERE HAD BEEN PRIVATELY SHE WAS OF THE OPINION THAT MARILLA CUTHBERT SWEPT THAT YARD OVER AS OFTEN AS SHE SWEPT HER HOUSE
103-1240-0023.flac,ONE COULD HAVE EATEN A MEAL OFF THE GROUND WITHOUT OVERBRIMMING THE PROVERBIAL PECK OF DIRT MISSUS RACHEL RAPPED SMARTLY AT THE KITCHEN DOOR AND STEPPED IN WHEN BIDDEN TO DO SO THE KITCHEN AT GREEN GABLES WAS A CHEERFUL APARTMENT
103-1240-0024.flac,OR WOULD HAVE BEEN CHEERFUL IF IT HAD NOT BEEN SO PAINFULLY CLEAN AS TO GIVE IT SOMETHING OF THE APPEARANCE OF AN UNUSED PARLOR ITS WINDOWS LOOKED EAST AND WEST THROUGH THE WEST ONE LOOKING OUT ON THE BACK YARD CAME A FLOOD OF MELLOW JUNE SUNLIGHT BUT THE EAST ONE
103-1240-0025.flac,WHENCE YOU GOT A GLIMPSE OF THE BLOOM WHITE CHERRY TREES IN THE LEFT ORCHARD AND NODDING SLENDER BIRCHES DOWN IN THE HOLLOW BY THE BROOK WAS GREENED OVER BY A TANGLE OF VINES HERE SAT MARILLA CUTHBERT WHEN SHE SAT AT ALL ALWAYS SLIGHTLY DISTRUSTFUL OF SUNSHINE
103-1240-0026.flac,AND HERE SHE SAT NOW KNITTING AND THE TABLE BEHIND HER WAS LAID FOR SUPPER MISSUS RACHEL BEFORE SHE HAD FAIRLY CLOSED THE DOOR
103-1240-0027.flac,THERE WERE THREE PLATES LAID SO THAT MARILLA MUST BE EXPECTING SOME ONE HOME WITH MATTHEW TO TEA BUT THE DISHES WERE EVERYDAY DISHES AND THERE WAS ONLY CRAB APPLE PRESERVES AND ONE KIND OF CAKE SO THAT THE EXPECTED COMPANY COULD NOT BE ANY PARTICULAR COMPANY
103-1240-0028.flac,YET WHAT OF MATTHEW'S WHITE COLLAR AND THE SORREL MARE MISSUS RACHEL WAS GETTING FAIRLY DIZZY WITH THIS UNUSUAL MYSTERY ABOUT QUIET UNMYSTERIOUS GREEN GABLES GOOD EVENING RACHEL MARILLA SAID BRISKLY THIS IS A REAL FINE EVENING ISN'T IT WON'T YOU SIT DOWN
103-1240-0029.flac,HOW ARE ALL YOUR FOLKS SOMETHING THAT FOR LACK OF ANY OTHER NAME MIGHT BE CALLED FRIENDSHIP EXISTED AND ALWAYS HAD EXISTED BETWEEN MARILLA CUTHBERT AND MISSUS RACHEL IN SPITE OF OR PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THEIR DISSIMILARITY MARILLA WAS A TALL
103-1240-0030.flac,THIN WOMAN WITH ANGLES AND WITHOUT CURVES HER DARK HAIR SHOWED SOME GRAY STREAKS AND WAS ALWAYS TWISTED UP IN A HARD LITTLE KNOT BEHIND WITH TWO WIRE HAIRPINS STUCK AGGRESSIVELY THROUGH IT SHE LOOKED LIKE A WOMAN OF NARROW EXPERIENCE AND RIGID CONSCIENCE WHICH SHE WAS
103-1240-0031.flac,BUT THERE WAS A SAVING SOMETHING ABOUT HER MOUTH WHICH IF IT HAD BEEN EVER SO SLIGHTLY DEVELOPED MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED INDICATIVE OF A SENSE OF HUMOR WE'RE ALL PRETTY WELL SAID MISSUS RACHEL I WAS KIND OF AFRAID YOU WEREN'T THOUGH WHEN I SAW MATTHEW STARTING OFF TODAY I THOUGHT MAYBE HE WAS GOING TO THE DOCTOR'S
103-1240-0032.flac,MARILLA'S LIPS TWITCHED UNDERSTANDINGLY SHE HAD EXPECTED MISSUS RACHEL UP SHE HAD KNOWN THAT THE SIGHT OF MATTHEW JAUNTING OFF SO UNACCOUNTABLY WOULD BE TOO MUCH FOR HER NEIGHBOR'S CURIOSITY OH NO I'M QUITE WELL ALTHOUGH I HAD A BAD HEADACHE YESTERDAY SHE SAID
103-1240-0033.flac,MATTHEW WENT TO BRIGHT RIVER WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE BOY FROM AN ORPHAN ASYLUM IN NOVA SCOTIA AND HE'S COMING ON THE TRAIN TONIGHT IF MARILLA HAD SAID THAT MATTHEW HAD GONE TO BRIGHT RIVER TO MEET A KANGAROO FROM AUSTRALIA MISSUS RACHEL COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ASTONISHED
103-1240-0034.flac,SHE WAS ACTUALLY STRICKEN DUMB FOR FIVE SECONDS IT WAS UNSUPPOSABLE THAT MARILLA WAS MAKING FUN OF HER BUT MISSUS RACHEL WAS ALMOST FORCED TO SUPPOSE IT ARE YOU IN EARNEST MARILLA SHE DEMANDED WHEN VOICE RETURNED TO HER YES OF COURSE
103-1240-0035.flac,SAID MARILLA AS IF GETTING BOYS FROM ORPHAN ASYLUMS IN NOVA SCOTIA WERE PART OF THE USUAL SPRING WORK ON ANY WELL REGULATED AVONLEA FARM INSTEAD OF BEING AN UNHEARD OF INNOVATION MISSUS RACHEL FELT THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE MENTAL JOLT SHE THOUGHT IN EXCLAMATION POINTS
103-1240-0036.flac,MARILLA AND MATTHEW CUTHBERT OF ALL PEOPLE ADOPTING A BOY FROM AN ORPHAN ASYLUM WELL THE WORLD WAS CERTAINLY TURNING UPSIDE DOWN SHE WOULD BE SURPRISED AT NOTHING AFTER THIS NOTHING
103-1240-0037.flac,WHAT ON EARTH PUT SUCH A NOTION INTO YOUR HEAD SHE DEMANDED DISAPPROVINGLY THIS HAD BEEN DONE WITHOUT HER ADVICE BEING ASKED AND MUST PERFORCE BE DISAPPROVED WELL WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR SOME TIME ALL WINTER IN FACT RETURNED MARILLA
103-1240-0038.flac,MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER WAS UP HERE ONE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO GET A LITTLE GIRL FROM THE ASYLUM OVER IN HOPETON IN THE SPRING
103-1240-0039.flac,SO MATTHEW AND I HAVE TALKED IT OVER OFF AND ON EVER SINCE WE THOUGHT WE'D GET A BOY MATTHEW IS GETTING UP IN YEARS YOU KNOW HE'S SIXTY AND HE ISN'T SO SPRY AS HE ONCE WAS HIS HEART TROUBLES HIM A GOOD DEAL AND YOU KNOW HOW DESPERATE HARD IT'S GOT TO BE TO GET HIRED HELP
103-1240-0040.flac,THERE'S NEVER ANYBODY TO BE HAD BUT THOSE STUPID HALF GROWN LITTLE FRENCH BOYS AND AS SOON AS YOU DO GET ONE BROKE INTO YOUR WAYS AND TAUGHT SOMETHING HE'S UP AND OFF TO THE LOBSTER CANNERIES OR THE STATES AT FIRST MATTHEW SUGGESTED GETTING A HOME BOY BUT I SAID NO FLAT TO THAT
103-1240-0041.flac,THEY MAY BE ALL RIGHT I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE NOT BUT NO LONDON STREET ARABS FOR ME I SAID GIVE ME A NATIVE BORN AT LEAST THERE'LL BE A RISK NO MATTER WHO WE GET BUT I'LL FEEL EASIER IN MY MIND AND SLEEP SOUNDER AT NIGHTS IF WE GET A BORN CANADIAN
103-1240-0042.flac,SO IN THE END WE DECIDED TO ASK MISSUS SPENCER TO PICK US OUT ONE WHEN SHE WENT OVER TO GET HER LITTLE GIRL WE HEARD LAST WEEK SHE WAS GOING SO WE SENT HER WORD BY RICHARD SPENCER'S FOLKS AT CARMODY TO BRING US A SMART LIKELY BOY OF ABOUT TEN OR ELEVEN WE DECIDED THAT WOULD BE THE BEST AGE
103-1240-0043.flac,OLD ENOUGH TO BE OF SOME USE IN DOING CHORES RIGHT OFF AND YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE TRAINED UP PROPER WE MEAN TO GIVE HIM A GOOD HOME AND SCHOOLING WE HAD A TELEGRAM FROM MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER TODAY THE MAIL MAN BROUGHT IT FROM THE STATION SAYING THEY WERE COMING ON THE FIVE THIRTY TRAIN TONIGHT
103-1240-0044.flac,SO MATTHEW WENT TO BRIGHT RIVER TO MEET HIM MISSUS SPENCER WILL DROP HIM OFF THERE OF COURSE SHE GOES ON TO WHITE SANDS STATION HERSELF MISSUS RACHEL PRIDED HERSELF ON ALWAYS SPEAKING HER MIND SHE PROCEEDED TO SPEAK IT NOW HAVING ADJUSTED HER MENTAL ATTITUDE TO THIS AMAZING PIECE OF NEWS
103-1240-0045.flac,WELL MARILLA I'LL JUST TELL YOU PLAIN THAT I THINK YOU'RE DOING A MIGHTY FOOLISH THING A RISKY THING THAT'S WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING YOU'RE BRINGING A STRANGE CHILD INTO YOUR HOUSE AND HOME AND YOU DON'T KNOW A SINGLE THING ABOUT HIM NOR WHAT HIS DISPOSITION IS LIKE NOR WHAT SORT OF PARENTS HE HAD
103-1240-0046.flac,NOR HOW HE'S LIKELY TO TURN OUT WHY IT WAS ONLY LAST WEEK I READ IN THE PAPER HOW A MAN AND HIS WIFE UP WEST OF THE ISLAND TOOK A BOY OUT OF AN ORPHAN ASYLUM AND HE SET FIRE TO THE HOUSE AT NIGHT SET IT ON PURPOSE MARILLA AND NEARLY BURNT THEM TO A CRISP IN THEIR BEDS
103-1240-0047.flac,AND I KNOW ANOTHER CASE WHERE AN ADOPTED BOY USED TO SUCK THE EGGS THEY COULDN'T BREAK HIM OF IT IF YOU HAD ASKED MY ADVICE IN THE MATTER WHICH YOU DIDN'T DO MARILLA I'D HAVE SAID FOR MERCY'S SAKE NOT TO THINK OF SUCH A THING THAT'S WHAT
103-1240-0048.flac,THIS JOB'S COMFORTING SEEMED NEITHER TO OFFEND NOR TO ALARM MARILLA SHE KNITTED STEADILY ON I DON'T DENY THERE'S SOMETHING IN WHAT YOU SAY RACHEL I'VE HAD SOME QUALMS MYSELF BUT MATTHEW WAS TERRIBLE SET ON IT I COULD SEE THAT SO I GAVE IN
103-1240-0049.flac,IT'S SO SELDOM MATTHEW SETS HIS MIND ON ANYTHING THAT WHEN HE DOES I ALWAYS FEEL IT'S MY DUTY TO GIVE IN AND AS FOR THE RISK THERE'S RISKS IN PRETTY NEAR EVERYTHING A BODY DOES IN THIS WORLD THERE'S RISKS IN PEOPLE'S HAVING CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN IF IT COMES TO THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS TURN OUT WELL
103-1240-0050.flac,AND THEN NOVA SCOTIA IS RIGHT CLOSE TO THE ISLAND IT ISN'T AS IF WE WERE GETTING HIM FROM ENGLAND OR THE STATES HE CAN'T BE MUCH DIFFERENT FROM OURSELVES WELL I HOPE IT WILL TURN OUT ALL RIGHT SAID MISSUS RACHEL IN A TONE THAT PLAINLY INDICATED HER PAINFUL DOUBTS
103-1240-0051.flac,ONLY DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU IF HE BURNS GREEN GABLES DOWN OR PUTS STRYCHNINE IN THE WELL I HEARD OF A CASE OVER IN NEW BRUNSWICK WHERE AN ORPHAN ASYLUM CHILD DID THAT AND THE WHOLE FAMILY DIED IN FEARFUL AGONIES ONLY IT WAS A GIRL IN THAT INSTANCE WELL WE'RE NOT GETTING A GIRL SAID MARILLA
103-1240-0052.flac,AS IF POISONING WELLS WERE A PURELY FEMININE ACCOMPLISHMENT AND NOT TO BE DREADED IN THE CASE OF A BOY I'D NEVER DREAM OF TAKING A GIRL TO BRING UP I WONDER AT MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER FOR DOING IT BUT THERE SHE WOULDN'T SHRINK FROM ADOPTING A WHOLE ORPHAN ASYLUM IF SHE TOOK IT INTO HER HEAD
103-1240-0053.flac,MISSUS RACHEL WOULD HAVE LIKED TO STAY UNTIL MATTHEW CAME HOME WITH HIS IMPORTED ORPHAN BUT REFLECTING THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD TWO HOURS AT LEAST BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL SHE CONCLUDED TO GO UP THE ROAD TO ROBERT BELL'S AND TELL THE NEWS IT WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE A SENSATION SECOND TO NONE
103-1240-0054.flac,AND MISSUS RACHEL DEARLY LOVED TO MAKE A SENSATION SO SHE TOOK HERSELF AWAY SOMEWHAT TO MARILLA'S RELIEF FOR THE LATTER FELT HER DOUBTS AND FEARS REVIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MISSUS RACHEL'S PESSIMISM WELL OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER WERE OR WILL BE EJACULATED MISSUS RACHEL WHEN SHE WAS SAFELY OUT IN THE LANE
103-1240-0055.flac,IT DOES REALLY SEEM AS IF I MUST BE DREAMING WELL I'M SORRY FOR THAT POOR YOUNG ONE AND NO MISTAKE MATTHEW AND MARILLA DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CHILDREN AND THEY'LL EXPECT HIM TO BE WISER AND STEADIER THAT HIS OWN GRANDFATHER
103-1240-0056.flac,IT SEEMS UNCANNY TO THINK OF A CHILD AT GREEN GABLES SOMEHOW THERE'S NEVER BEEN ONE THERE FOR MATTHEW AND MARILLA WERE GROWN UP WHEN THE NEW HOUSE WAS BUILT IF THEY EVER WERE CHILDREN WHICH IS HARD TO BELIEVE WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THEM I WOULDN'T BE IN THAT ORPHAN'S SHOES FOR ANYTHING
103-1240-0057.flac,MY BUT I PITY HIM THAT'S WHAT SO SAID MISSUS RACHEL TO THE WILD ROSE BUSHES OUT OF THE FULNESS OF HER HEART
103-1241-0000.flac,CHAPTER TWO MATTHEW CUTHBERT IS SURPRISED MATTHEW CUTHBERT AND THE SORREL MARE JOGGED COMFORTABLY OVER THE EIGHT MILES TO BRIGHT RIVER IT WAS A PRETTY ROAD RUNNING ALONG BETWEEN SNUG FARMSTEADS WITH NOW AND AGAIN A BIT OF BALSAMY FIR WOOD TO DRIVE THROUGH
103-1241-0001.flac,OR A HOLLOW WHERE WILD PLUMS HUNG OUT THEIR FILMY BLOOM THE AIR WAS SWEET WITH THE BREATH OF MANY APPLE ORCHARDS AND THE MEADOWS SLOPED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE TO HORIZON MISTS OF PEARL AND PURPLE WHILE THE LITTLE BIRDS SANG AS IF IT WERE THE ONE DAY OF SUMMER IN ALL THE YEAR
103-1241-0002.flac,MATTHEW ENJOYED THE DRIVE AFTER HIS OWN FASHION EXCEPT DURING THE MOMENTS WHEN HE MET WOMEN AND HAD TO NOD TO THEM FOR IN PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO NOD TO ALL AND SUNDRY YOU MEET ON THE ROAD WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM OR NOT MATTHEW DREADED ALL WOMEN EXCEPT MARILLA AND MISSUS RACHEL
103-1241-0003.flac,HE HAD AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING THAT THE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES WERE SECRETLY LAUGHING AT HIM HE MAY HAVE BEEN QUITE RIGHT IN THINKING SO FOR HE WAS AN ODD LOOKING PERSONAGE WITH AN UNGAINLY FIGURE AND LONG IRON GRAY HAIR THAT TOUCHED HIS STOOPING SHOULDERS
103-1241-0004.flac,AND A FULL SOFT BROWN BEARD WHICH HE HAD WORN EVER SINCE HE WAS TWENTY IN FACT HE HAD LOOKED AT TWENTY VERY MUCH AS HE LOOKED AT SIXTY LACKING A LITTLE OF THE GRAYNESS WHEN HE REACHED BRIGHT RIVER THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY TRAIN
103-1241-0005.flac,HE THOUGHT HE WAS TOO EARLY SO HE TIED HIS HORSE IN THE YARD OF THE SMALL BRIGHT RIVER HOTEL AND WENT OVER TO THE STATION HOUSE THE LONG PLATFORM WAS ALMOST DESERTED THE ONLY LIVING CREATURE IN SIGHT BEING A GIRL WHO WAS SITTING ON A PILE OF SHINGLES AT THE EXTREME END
103-1241-0006.flac,MATTHEW BARELY NOTING THAT IT WAS A GIRL SIDLED PAST HER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER HAD HE LOOKED HE COULD HARDLY HAVE FAILED TO NOTICE THE TENSE RIGIDITY AND EXPECTATION OF HER ATTITUDE AND EXPRESSION SHE WAS SITTING THERE WAITING FOR SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY
103-1241-0007.flac,AND SINCE SITTING AND WAITING WAS THE ONLY THING TO DO JUST THEN SHE SAT AND WAITED WITH ALL HER MIGHT AND MAIN MATTHEW ENCOUNTERED THE STATIONMASTER LOCKING UP THE TICKET OFFICE PREPARATORY TO GOING HOME FOR SUPPER AND ASKED HIM IF THE FIVE THIRTY TRAIN WOULD SOON BE ALONG
103-1241-0008.flac,THE FIVE THIRTY TRAIN HAS BEEN IN AND GONE HALF AN HOUR AGO ANSWERED THAT BRISK OFFICIAL BUT THERE WAS A PASSENGER DROPPED OFF FOR YOU A LITTLE GIRL SHE'S SITTING OUT THERE ON THE SHINGLES I ASKED HER TO GO INTO THE LADIES WAITING ROOM BUT SHE INFORMED ME GRAVELY THAT SHE PREFERRED TO STAY OUTSIDE
103-1241-0009.flac,SHE'S A CASE I SHOULD SAY I'M NOT EXPECTING A GIRL SAID MATTHEW BLANKLY IT'S A BOY I'VE COME FOR HE SHOULD BE HERE MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER WAS TO BRING HIM OVER FROM NOVA SCOTIA FOR ME THE STATIONMASTER WHISTLED
103-1241-0010.flac,GUESS THERE'S SOME MISTAKE HE SAID MISSUS SPENCER CAME OFF THE TRAIN WITH THAT GIRL AND GAVE HER INTO MY CHARGE SAID YOU AND YOUR SISTER WERE ADOPTING HER FROM AN ORPHAN ASYLUM AND THAT YOU WOULD BE ALONG FOR HER PRESENTLY THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT IT AND I HAVEN'T GOT ANY MORE ORPHANS CONCEALED HEREABOUTS
103-1241-0011.flac,I DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID MATTHEW HELPLESSLY WISHING THAT MARILLA WAS AT HAND TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION WELL YOU'D BETTER QUESTION THE GIRL SAID THE STATION MASTER CARELESSLY I DARE SAY SHE'LL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN SHE'S GOT A TONGUE OF HER OWN THAT'S CERTAIN
103-1241-0012.flac,MAYBE THEY WERE OUT OF BOYS OF THE BRAND YOU WANTED HE WALKED JAUNTILY AWAY BEING HUNGRY AND THE UNFORTUNATE MATTHEW WAS LEFT TO DO THAT WHICH WAS HARDER FOR HIM THAN BEARDING A LION IN ITS DEN WALK UP TO A GIRL A STRANGE GIRL AN ORPHAN GIRL
103-1241-0013.flac,AND DEMAND OF HER WHY SHE WASN'T A BOY MATTHEW GROANED IN SPIRIT AS HE TURNED ABOUT AND SHUFFLED GENTLY DOWN THE PLATFORM TOWARDS HER SHE HAD BEEN WATCHING HIM EVER SINCE HE HAD PASSED HER AND SHE HAD HER EYES ON HIM NOW MATTHEW WAS NOT LOOKING AT HER
103-1241-0014.flac,A CHILD OF ABOUT ELEVEN GARBED IN A VERY SHORT VERY TIGHT VERY UGLY DRESS OF YELLOWISH GRAY WINCEY SHE WORE A FADED BROWN SAILOR HAT AND BENEATH THE HAT EXTENDING DOWN HER BACK WERE TWO BRAIDS OF VERY THICK DECIDEDLY RED HAIR
103-1241-0015.flac,HER FACE WAS SMALL WHITE AND THIN ALSO MUCH FRECKLED HER MOUTH WAS LARGE AND SO WERE HER EYES WHICH LOOKED GREEN IN SOME LIGHTS AND MOODS AND GRAY IN OTHERS SO FAR THE ORDINARY OBSERVER AN EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVER
103-1241-0016.flac,MIGHT HAVE SEEN THAT THE CHIN WAS VERY POINTED AND PRONOUNCED THAT THE BIG EYES WERE FULL OF SPIRIT AND VIVACITY THAT THE MOUTH WAS SWEET LIPPED AND EXPRESSIVE THAT THE FOREHEAD WAS BROAD AND FULL IN SHORT OUR DISCERNING EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE CONCLUDED
103-1241-0017.flac,WAS SO LUDICROUSLY AFRAID MATTHEW HOWEVER WAS SPARED THE ORDEAL OF SPEAKING FIRST FOR AS SOON AS SHE CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS COMING TO HER SHE STOOD UP GRASPING WITH ONE THIN BROWN HAND THE HANDLE OF A SHABBY OLD FASHIONED CARPET BAG THE OTHER SHE HELD OUT TO HIM
103-1241-0018.flac,I SUPPOSE YOU ARE MISTER MATTHEW CUTHBERT OF GREEN GABLES SHE SAID IN A PECULIARLY CLEAR SWEET VOICE I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU I WAS BEGINNING TO BE AFRAID YOU WEREN'T COMING FOR ME
103-1241-0019.flac,I HAD MADE UP MY MIND THAT IF YOU DIDN'T COME FOR ME TO NIGHT
103-1241-0020.flac,I WOULDN'T BE A BIT AFRAID AND IT WOULD BE LOVELY TO SLEEP IN A WILD CHERRY TREE ALL WHITE WITH BLOOM IN THE MOONSHINE DON'T YOU THINK YOU COULD IMAGINE YOU WERE DWELLING IN MARBLE HALLS COULDN'T YOU
103-1241-0021.flac,MATTHEW HAD TAKEN THE SCRAWNY LITTLE HAND AWKWARDLY IN HIS THEN AND THERE HE DECIDED WHAT TO DO HE COULD NOT TELL THIS CHILD WITH THE GLOWING EYES THAT THERE HAD BEEN A MISTAKE HE WOULD TAKE HER HOME AND LET MARILLA DO THAT SHE COULDN'T BE LEFT AT BRIGHT RIVER ANYHOW
103-1241-0022.flac,NO MATTER WHAT MISTAKE HAD BEEN MADE SO ALL QUESTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS MIGHT AS WELL BE DEFERRED UNTIL HE WAS SAFELY BACK AT GREEN GABLES I'M SORRY I WAS LATE HE SAID SHYLY COME ALONG THE HORSE IS OVER IN THE YARD GIVE ME YOUR BAG OH I CAN CARRY IT THE CHILD RESPONDED CHEERFULLY
103-1241-0023.flac,IT ISN'T HEAVY I'VE GOT ALL MY WORLDLY GOODS IN IT BUT IT ISN'T HEAVY AND IF IT ISN'T CARRIED IN JUST A CERTAIN WAY THE HANDLE PULLS OUT SO I'D BETTER KEEP IT BECAUSE I KNOW THE EXACT KNACK OF IT IT'S AN EXTREMELY OLD CARPET BAG OH I'M VERY GLAD YOU'VE COME EVEN IF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO SLEEP IN A WILD CHERRY TREE
103-1241-0024.flac,WE'VE GOT TO DRIVE A LONG PIECE HAVEN'T WE MISSUS SPENCER SAID IT WAS EIGHT MILES I'M GLAD BECAUSE I LOVE DRIVING OH IT SEEMS SO WONDERFUL THAT I'M GOING TO LIVE WITH YOU AND BELONG TO YOU I'VE NEVER BELONGED TO ANYBODY NOT REALLY BUT THE ASYLUM WAS THE WORST I'VE ONLY BEEN IN IT FOUR MONTHS BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH
103-1241-0025.flac,IT'S WORSE THAN ANYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE MISSUS SPENCER SAID IT WAS WICKED OF ME TO TALK LIKE THAT
103-1241-0026.flac,THEY WERE GOOD YOU KNOW THE ASYLUM PEOPLE BUT THERE IS SO LITTLE SCOPE FOR THE IMAGINATION IN AN ASYLUM ONLY JUST IN THE OTHER ORPHANS IT WAS PRETTY INTERESTING TO IMAGINE THINGS ABOUT THEM
103-1241-0027.flac,WHO HAD BEEN STOLEN AWAY FROM HER PARENTS IN HER INFANCY BY A CRUEL NURSE WHO DIED BEFORE SHE COULD CONFESS I USED TO LIE AWAKE AT NIGHTS AND IMAGINE THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE TIME IN THE DAY I GUESS THAT'S WHY I'M SO THIN I AM DREADFUL THIN AIN'T I THERE ISN'T A PICK ON MY BONES
103-1241-0028.flac,I DO LOVE TO IMAGINE I'M NICE AND PLUMP WITH DIMPLES IN MY ELBOWS WITH THIS MATTHEW'S COMPANION STOPPED TALKING PARTLY BECAUSE SHE WAS OUT OF BREATH AND PARTLY BECAUSE THEY HAD REACHED THE BUGGY NOT ANOTHER WORD DID SHE SAY UNTIL THEY HAD LEFT THE VILLAGE AND WERE DRIVING DOWN A STEEP LITTLE HILL
103-1241-0029.flac,THE ROAD PART OF WHICH HAD BEEN CUT SO DEEPLY INTO THE SOFT SOIL THAT THE BANKS FRINGED WITH BLOOMING WILD CHERRY TREES AND SLIM WHITE BIRCHES WERE SEVERAL FEET ABOVE THEIR HEADS THE CHILD PUT OUT HER HAND AND BROKE OFF A BRANCH OF WILD PLUM THAT BRUSHED AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE BUGGY
103-1241-0030.flac,ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL WHAT DID THAT TREE LEANING OUT FROM THE BANK ALL WHITE AND LACY MAKE YOU THINK OF SHE ASKED WELL NOW I DUNNO SAID MATTHEW WHY A BRIDE OF COURSE A BRIDE ALL IN WHITE WITH A LOVELY MISTY VEIL
103-1241-0031.flac,I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BUT I CAN IMAGINE WHAT SHE WOULD LOOK LIKE I DON'T EVER EXPECT TO BE A BRIDE MYSELF I'M SO HOMELY NOBODY WILL EVER WANT TO MARRY ME UNLESS IT MIGHT BE A FOREIGN MISSIONARY I SUPPOSE A FOREIGN MISSIONARY MIGHTN'T BE VERY PARTICULAR
103-1241-0032.flac,BUT I DO HOPE THAT SOME DAY I SHALL HAVE A WHITE DRESS THAT IS MY HIGHEST IDEAL OF EARTHLY BLISS I JUST LOVE PRETTY CLOTHES AND I'VE NEVER HAD A PRETTY DRESS IN MY LIFE THAT I CAN REMEMBER BUT OF COURSE IT'S ALL THE MORE TO LOOK FORWARD TO ISN'T IT AND THEN
103-1241-0033.flac,I CAN IMAGINE THAT I'M DRESSED GORGEOUSLY THIS MORNING WHEN I LEFT THE ASYLUM I FELT SO ASHAMED BECAUSE I HAD TO WEAR THIS HORRID OLD WINCEY DRESS ALL THE ORPHANS HAD TO WEAR THEM YOU KNOW A MERCHANT IN HOPETON LAST WINTER DONATED THREE HUNDRED YARDS OF WINCEY TO THE ASYLUM SOME PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BECAUSE HE COULDN'T SELL IT
103-1241-0034.flac,BUT I'D RATHER BELIEVE THAT IT WAS OUT OF THE KINDNESS OF HIS HEART WOULDN'T YOU WHEN WE GOT ON THE TRAIN I FELT AS IF EVERYBODY MUST BE LOOKING AT ME AND PITYING ME BUT I JUST WENT TO WORK AND IMAGINED THAT I HAD ON THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PALE BLUE SILK DRESS BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE IMAGINING YOU MIGHT AS WELL IMAGINE SOMETHING WORTH WHILE
103-1241-0035.flac,AND A BIG HAT ALL FLOWERS AND NODDING PLUMES AND A GOLD WATCH AND KID GLOVES AND BOOTS I FELT CHEERED UP RIGHT AWAY AND I ENJOYED MY TRIP TO THE ISLAND WITH ALL MY MIGHT I WASN'T A BIT SICK COMING OVER IN THE BOAT NEITHER WAS MISSUS SPENCER ALTHOUGH SHE GENERALLY IS
103-1241-0036.flac,SHE SAID SHE HADN'T TIME TO GET SICK WATCHING TO SEE THAT I DIDN'T FALL OVERBOARD SHE SAID SHE NEVER SAW THE BEAT OF ME FOR PROWLING ABOUT BUT IF IT KEPT HER FROM BEING SEASICK IT'S A MERCY I DID PROWL ISN'T IT AND I WANTED TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO BE SEEN ON THAT BOAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I'D EVER HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY
103-1241-0037.flac,OH THERE ARE A LOT MORE CHERRY TREES ALL IN BLOOM THIS ISLAND IS THE BLOOMIEST PLACE I JUST LOVE IT ALREADY AND I'M SO GLAD I'M GOING TO LIVE HERE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD THAT PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND WAS THE PRETTIEST PLACE IN THE WORLD
103-1241-0038.flac,AND I USED TO IMAGINE I WAS LIVING HERE BUT I NEVER REALLY EXPECTED I WOULD IT'S DELIGHTFUL WHEN YOUR IMAGINATIONS COME TRUE ISN'T IT BUT THOSE RED ROADS ARE SO FUNNY WHEN WE GOT INTO THE TRAIN AT CHARLOTTETOWN AND THE RED ROADS BEGAN TO FLASH PAST I ASKED MISSUS SPENCER WHAT MADE THEM RED
103-1241-0039.flac,AND SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW AND FOR PITY'S SAKE NOT TO ASK HER ANY MORE QUESTIONS SHE SAID I MUST HAVE ASKED HER A THOUSAND ALREADY I SUPPOSE I HAD TOO BUT HOW YOU GOING TO FIND OUT ABOUT THINGS IF YOU DON'T ASK QUESTIONS AND WHAT DOES MAKE THE ROADS RED WELL NOW I DUNNO SAID MATTHEW

103-1241-0041.flac,WAS ENJOYING HIMSELF LIKE MOST QUIET FOLKS HE LIKED TALKATIVE PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE WILLING TO DO THE TALKING THEMSELVES AND DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO KEEP UP HIS END OF IT BUT HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED TO ENJOY THE SOCIETY OF A LITTLE GIRL WOMEN WERE BAD ENOUGH IN ALL CONSCIENCE BUT LITTLE GIRLS WERE WORSE
103-1241-0042.flac,HE DETESTED THE WAY THEY HAD OF SIDLING PAST HIM TIMIDLY WITH SIDEWISE GLANCES AS IF THEY EXPECTED HIM TO GOBBLE THEM UP AT A MOUTHFUL IF THEY VENTURED TO SAY A WORD THAT WAS THE AVONLEA TYPE OF WELL BRED LITTLE GIRL BUT THIS FRECKLED WITCH WAS VERY DIFFERENT
103-1241-0043.flac,AND ALTHOUGH HE FOUND IT RATHER DIFFICULT FOR HIS SLOWER INTELLIGENCE TO KEEP UP WITH HER BRISK MENTAL PROCESSES
4014-186179-0000.flac,THE FOLLOWING MORNING ALL OF THOSE WHO HAD ARRIVED ON THE TRANSPORTS WERE ESTABLISHED IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP BUT IT WAS MERELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSPECTION OF MEN AND EQUIPMENT AND WAS NOT TO BE FOR LONG

4014-186179-0036.flac,AND IF WOUNDED MIGHT OTHERWISE STARVE TO DEATH
4014-186179-0037.flac,AND PROMPTLY AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THEY STARTED UPON THE DANGEROUS MISSION WITH NIGHTFALL THE BIG CANNONADING HAD NOTICEABLY SHUT DOWN
4014-186179-0038.flac,IT WAS A BLACK NIGHT AND THEY PROCEEDED WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION THEY DID NOT DARE USE THE FLASHLIGHTS THAT EACH OF THEM CARRIED AND FREQUENTLY ALL OF THEM WOULD HAVE TO DROP SUDDENLY FLAT UPON THE GROUND AS A BIG ROCKET WENT UP FROM EITHER SIDE
4014-186179-0039.flac,IN THIS WAY THEY WENT FORWARD YARD BY YARD UNTIL THEY REACHED A THICK CLUMP OF TREES THERE AFTER LISTENING INTENTLY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WITHOUT HEARING A DANGEROUS SOUND THEY SPREAD OUT THEIR COATS TENT LIKE WHILE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON WITH GINGERLY FLASHES OF HIS LIGHT
4014-186179-0040.flac,EXAMINED THE MAP AGAIN TO MAKE CERTAIN OF THEIR LOCATION
4014-186179-0041.flac,WHILE TOM RAWLE QUIETLY CHUCKLING AT THE FAT LAD'S MISFORTUNE AIDED HIM TO HIS FEET DOWN FLAT SAID MACKINSON AGAIN AS HE DISCERNED SEVERAL SHADOWS MOVING ACROSS A SPACE A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE TO THE NORTH OF THEM
4014-186179-0042.flac,FOR FULLY TEN MINUTES WHICH SEEMED LIKE AN HOUR THEY LAY THERE NOT DARING TO MOVE THEY WATCHED THE ENEMY SCOUTING PARTY GET A LIKE SCARE AND THEN AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO BE A WHISPERED CONSULTATION TURN BACK TO THE GERMAN LINES
4014-186179-0043.flac,WHAT DID YOU FALL OVER THE LIEUTENANT FINALLY ASKED OF SLIM IN A SCARCELY AUDIBLE TONE I JUST FOUND IT REPLIED SLIM
4014-186179-0044.flac,COPPER EXCLAIMED THE LIEUTENANT HOSKINS LET ME HAVE THAT KIT
4014-186179-0045.flac,A VERY SMALL TELEGRAPH INSTRUMENT THE INSTANT IT WAS ATTACHED TO THE WIRE THE RECEIVER BEGAN TO TICK IRREGULARLY NEITHER RAWLE NOR HOSKINS UNDERSTOOD GERMAN BUT TO THE OTHERS THEY WERE WORDS EASY TO TRANSLATE THEY HAD ACCIDENTALLY STRUCK AN ENEMY WIRE AND HAD TAPPED IT
4014-186179-0046.flac,LEAD ENEMY TO BELIEVE WHOLE ATTACK CENTERED FROM YOUR POSITION
4014-186183-0000.flac,FRANK HOSKINS ELBOW WOUND HEALED QUICKLY WITHOUT ANY SERIOUS RESULTS AND TOM RAWLE WHO HAD BEEN UNDER TREATMENT AT THE FIELD HOSPITAL WAS ABLE TO GET ABOUT THE CAMP
4014-186183-0001.flac,BUT ON THE EIGHTH DAY A VERITABLE FURY LAUNCHED ITSELF UPON THAT SECTION OF THE AMERICAN FRENCH FRONT IN THE SHAPE OF SEEMINGLY ENDLESS BRIGADES OF BOCHES THAT WERE HURLED OVER THE TOP OF THEIR OWN BREASTWORKS ACROSS NO MAN'S LAND AND UPON THE FIRST LINE TRENCHES OF THE ALLIES
4014-186183-0002.flac,FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE AMERICAN AND FRENCH AVIATORS HAD BEEN REPORTING HEAVY GERMAN FORMATIONS IN THAT REGION EVIDENTLY WITH THE DESIGN OF A TERRIFIC ASSAULT BUT THE ALLIED COMMANDERS HAD NOT EXPECTED IT SO SOON AND IN TRUTH THEY WERE NOT FULLY PREPARED FOR IT
4014-186183-0003.flac,IT WAS A SURPRISE ATTACK IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD WITH ALL THE TERRIBLE CARNAGE THAT SUCH A BATTLE BRINGS
4014-186183-0004.flac,AND THEIR HIDDEN ARTILLERY TO THE REAR OF THEM THIS WAS KEPT UP FOR ABOUT SEVEN HOURS AND THE DUEL OF HEAVY GUNS SHOOK THE EARTH LIKE A QUAKE AND WAS DEAFENING THEN JUST AS DAWN WAS BREAKING THE INFANTRY ONSLAUGHT
4014-186183-0005.flac,INCLUDING FOOD AND AMMUNITION TRAINS
4014-186183-0006.flac,EVERYTHING MOVED LIKE CLOCKWORK AND WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE SPEED AND THROUGHOUT IT ALL MEN ON BOTH SIDES WERE SHOOTING SHOUTING SHRIEKING
4014-186183-0007.flac,OR LIFELESS BEFORE SUPERIOR NUMBERS
4014-186183-0008.flac,A STATIONARY BALLOON SHOWED WHERE JERRY AND AN OBSERVATION OFFICER WERE DOING DUTY ON THAT FATEFUL DAY JERRY WAS OPERATING A TELEPHONE THAT RAN DIRECTLY TO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS AND HARDLY A MOMENT PASSED WHEN HE WAS NOT REPEATING SOME OBSERVATION OF THE OTHER MAN IN THE BASKET WITH HIM
4014-186183-0009.flac,EVERY DETAIL OF THAT TREMENDOUS BATTLE JERRY KNEW HIS OWN OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OVER THE SIDE INFORMED HIM OF THE TEMPORARY REVERSES HIS OWN ARMY WAS SUFFERING WHILE THE REMARKS OF THE OFFICER TOLD HIM WHERE THE GERMANS WERE MEETING THEIR BITTEREST REPULSES
4014-186183-0010.flac,WHERE THEY WERE DRAWING UP THEIR HEAVIEST FORCES OF RESERVES WHAT QUICK CHANGES WERE BEING MADE IN THEIR GENERAL LINE OF FORMATION AND HOW FAR BACK THEIR FORCES SEEMED TO EXTEND SLIM GOODWIN
4014-186183-0011.flac,TO MAKE SURE THAT THUS FAR HIS FRIEND WAS STILL SAFE
4014-186183-0012.flac,THE WAVERING SWAYING TARGET WAS WATCHED FROM TIME TO TIME AND SPECULATIONS MADE AS TO HOW LONG IT COULD REMAIN WITHOUT BEING PUNCTURED BY A BULLET
4014-186183-0013.flac,IT WAS NOW WELL INTO THE AFTERNOON THE GERMANS HAD SWEPT INTO THE PLACES VACATED BY THE AMERICANS AND FRENCH AND STILL THE BATTLE RAGED IT WAS NOW THAT SLIM BEGAN TO WAIT ANXIOUSLY FOR THE NEW DEVELOPMENT
4014-186183-0014.flac,THE AMERICANS AND FRENCH HAD RETREATED TO A GENERAL LINE WHICH PERMITTED A QUICK RE MOBILIZATION TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE THERE THEIR FRONT LINE RANKS HELD FIRM WHILE THE NEW FORMATION WAS BEING EFFECTED BEHIND THEM IT WAS ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN THIS WAS COMPLETE
4014-186183-0015.flac,AND SOON IN GREAT MEASURE AT LEAST HOSTILITIES WOULD BE SUSPENDED FOR THE NIGHT THEIR WORK COMPLETED
4014-186183-0016.flac,SO YOU CAN JUDGE PRETTY WELL FOR YOURSELF GUESS HE HAD A PRETTY GOOD BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE WHOLE THING SAID JOE AS THEY PASSED ON TO MEET AGAIN BEFORE MESS EXCEPT FOR SPASMODIC OUTBURSTS HERE AND THERE THE TRENCH DUEL HAD ALMOST ENTIRELY SUBSIDED
4014-186183-0017.flac,AND THE HEAVY ROAR OF THE ARTILLERY ALSO WAS PUNCTUATED WITH LONGER PAUSES
4014-186183-0018.flac,WHILE EACH SIDE TOOK ACCOUNT OF STOCK AND MADE NECESSARY REPAIRS OR ALTERED THEIR PLANS TO MEET THE NEW SITUATION OUR YOUNG FRIENDS WERE BUSY WITH WASH BASIN SOAP AND WATER
4014-186183-0019.flac,TAKING OFF THE GRIME IN PREPARATION FOR THE EVENING MEAL AND WONDERING WHERE JERRY WAS KEEPING HIMSELF ALL THE WHILE WHEN SUDDENLY A VERY STRANGE THING HAPPENED BEYOND THE ENEMY'S LINE
4014-186183-0020.flac,MORE EASILY HANDLED AEROPLANES AND USED IN GREAT NUMBERS BY THE GERMANS SHOT INTO THE AIR AT GREAT SPEED FROM BEHIND THE BOCHE ENTRENCHMENTS
4014-186183-0021.flac,IT SIMPLY INDICATED THAT THOSE MANNING THE AMERICAN AND FRENCH ANTI AIRCRAFT GUNS
4014-186183-0022.flac,AND EVEN THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A WELL DESIGNED HOAX
4014-186183-0023.flac,STILL GOING AT MAXIMUM SPEED AND NOW ON A STRAIGHT LINE TOWARD THE AMERICAN SIDE WITHOUT SEEKING A FURTHER HEIGHT THE TAUBE SEVERAL TIMES WAVERED AND A MOMENT LATER ALMOST TURNED OVER BUT THE PILOT RIGHTED HER
4014-186183-0024.flac,HE POINTED HER NOSE DOWNWARD TOWARD THE AMERICAN LINES FOUR AMERICAN PLANES SAILED OFF AND UPWARD TO MEET THE ONCOMING GERMAN AIR ARMADA BUT FROM THE GROUND IT COULD BE SEEN THAT THE MAN IN THE OBSERVER'S PLACE IN THE TAUBE WAS MAKING DESPERATE SIGNALS
4014-186183-0025.flac,THE AMERICAN PLANES MANEUVERED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO ENCIRCLE THE TAUBE
4014-186183-0026.flac,AND THE OTHER GERMAN PLANES TURNED BACK TOWARD THEIR OWN LINES THE TAUBE CONTINUED ON ITS WAVERING CRIPPLED DOWNWARD COURSE TOWARD THE ALLIED LINES
4014-186183-0027.flac,AS THE TAUBE CAME WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF THE GROUND AND RIGHTED HERSELF FOR A LANDING
4014-186183-0028.flac,OF ITS OWN MOMENTUM IT ROLLED TO WITHIN A TWO MINUTES RUN OF WHERE THE LIEUTENANT AND THE OTHERS HAD BEEN STANDING IN ANOTHER INSTANT IT WAS ENTIRELY SURROUNDED BY A CROWD OF CURIOUS AMERICAN SOLDIERS
4014-186183-0029.flac,AND AFTER DESCENDING A LITTLE BY PERMITTING SOME OF THE GAS TO ESCAPE WE JUMPED OVER THE SIDE OF THE BASKET AND CAME DOWN ON OUR PARACHUTES
4014-186183-0030.flac,BUT SOME OTHER GERMAN AVIATORS SAW THE AFFAIR APPARENTLY RECOGNIZED OUR UNIFORMS AND HARDLY GAVE US TIME TO MAKE A DECENT START SAY JERRY CONCLUDED THEY CERTAINLY DID PEBBLE US WITH MACHINE GUN BULLETS
4014-186183-0031.flac,OPENING THEM THE BOYS COULD HARDLY SUPPRESS THEIR JUBILATION STRIPPED OF THEIR OFFICIAL VERBIAGE THE LETTERS INFORMED THE YOUNG MEN THAT EACH OF THEM WAS MADE A CORPORAL JOE FOR VALOROUS SERVICE IN SAVING THE LIVES OF THREE AMERICANS ENTOMBED IN A CAVE
4014-186176-0000.flac,CHAPTER EIGHT THE DEATH OF THE SPY
4014-186176-0001.flac,THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT IT SEEMED HAD BEEN FOLLOWING A TRAIL WHICH HE BELIEVED WAS LEADING HIM CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE OBJECT OF THE HUNT AND IT WAS IN FORGING THE LINKS OF THIS CHAIN OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THE YOUNG OFFICER WAS LED INTO THE LOWER DEPTHS OF THE SHIP
4014-186176-0002.flac,PRESUMABLY FROM THE ENGINE OR BOILER ROOM THROW ASIDE SOMETHING AS HE HURRIED ALONG THE PASSAGEWAY LEADING FROM THE WIRELESS ROOM
4014-186176-0003.flac,AND YOU STOOPED TO PICK UP WHATEVER IT WAS THAT HAD BEEN THROWN AWAY
4014-186176-0004.flac,EVIDENTLY ALSO FROM THE BOILER OR ENGINE ROOM BRUSHED BY US HE HAD DISAPPEARED WHEN THE SAILOR SAID TO ME I THINK THAT WAS THE FELLOW THE ONE THAT JUST WENT BY NOT WANTING TO AROUSE HIS SUSPICIONS I ENDED THE CONVERSATION WITH A CASUAL REMARK AND THEN STROLLED AWAY UNTIL I WAS OUT OF THE SAILOR'S SIGHT
4014-186176-0005.flac,I WAS GROPING MY WAY ALONG WHEN I THOUGHT I HEARD STEPS JUST AHEAD OF ME I STOPPED TO LISTEN AND WHEN THE SOUND WAS NOT REPEATED I PROCEEDED ONWARD
4014-186176-0006.flac,BEFORE I COULD UTTER A WORD I WAS A PRISONER BEHIND A LOCKED DOOR I CALLED SEVERAL TIMES AND
4014-186176-0007.flac,EVERY MOMENT IT BECAME MORE STIFLING IN THERE AND I HAD NO DOUBT THAT I HAD WALKED DIRECTLY INTO A DEATH TRAP IT WAS THEN I BEGAN SIGNALING ON THE STEAM PIPE I GUESS IT WAS A MIGHTY LUCKY THING FOR ME THAT SLIM GOODWIN STROLLED OUT ON DECK JUST AT THE TIME HE DID
4014-186176-0008.flac,AND THAT WAS ALL THAT LIEUTENANT MACKINSON COULD TELL THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER REMAINED WHAT HE HAD BEEN FROM THE FIRST A DESPERATE AND DANGEROUS AND UNKNOWN SPY
4014-186176-0009.flac,PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER TO DEVISE A SCHEME OF CAPTURE WE'VE GOT MORE THAN ONE GOOD REASON FOR WANTING TO GET THIS FELLOW SLIM REMINDED THE OTHERS WITH CONSIDERABLE WARMTH
4014-186176-0010.flac,TO WHICH HE IS AN ENEMY AND A TRAITOR BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE IS THAT KNOCKOUT THAT HE HANDED TO JOE AND THE MIDNIGHT SCARE HE GAVE JERRY AND ME AND FINALLY HIS EFFORT TO KILL LIEUTENANT MACKINSON BY SLOW SUFFOCATION
4014-186176-0011.flac,WELL SAID JOE I THINK I'VE GOT A PLAN THAT WILL WORK BUT
4014-186176-0012.flac,WELL WHAT'S YOUR SUGGESTION SLIM DEMANDED THAT WE DIVIDE OUR FORCES ANSWERED JOE SOLEMNLY LIE IN WAIT AND TRY TO AMBUSH THE FOE RIGHT CRIED JERRY JOE YOU'LL BE A GENERAL BEFORE THIS WAR'S OVER
4014-186176-0013.flac,ALONG WHAT LINES DO WE DISPERSE OUR FORCES GENERAL ASKED SLIM ALONG WHAT LINES WOULD HIS ROYAL STOUTNESS SUGGEST DEMANDED JERRY OH YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP REMINDING ME THAT I'M A TRIFLE HEAVY SLIM REPLIED IN A PEEVISH TONE
4014-186176-0014.flac,A TRIFLE HEAVY GET THAT WILL YOU ECHOED JERRY WITH A GALE OF LAUGHTER A TRIFLE HEAVY OH MY YOU'LL FIND OUT IF I SIT ON YOU SLIM THREATENED IN A BELLIGERENT TONE
4014-186176-0015.flac,WON'T DO IT SLIM MUTTERED OH YES YOU WILL COUNSELED JOE SHAKE HANDS THE TWO OF YOU SLIM'S GOOD NATURE OVERCAME HIS FEIGNED RELUCTANCE BUT AS JERRY GRASPED HIS HAND HE GAVE JERRY A JERK THAT NEARLY TOOK HIM OFF HIS FEET NOW WE'RE SQUARE SAID SLIM
4014-186176-0016.flac,AND TO DO THAT HE WILL HAVE TO USE THE WIRELESS SOMEHOW IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT HE WOULD MAKE HIS EFFORT AT NIGHT
4014-186176-0017.flac,THE LIEUTENANT COULD BE IN THE WIRELESS ROOM AND ONE OF US IN THE BATTERY ROOM WHILE THE OTHER TWO DID DUTY OUTSIDE
4014-186176-0018.flac,IT WOULD BE TIRESOME AND MONOTONOUS WORK ALL RIGHT
4014-186176-0019.flac,I'M WILLING SAID JERRY BUT YOU AND I WILL HAVE TO DO THE OUTSIDE WORK
4014-186176-0020.flac,WELL I'LL COVER THE BATTERY ROOM SAID SLIM IGNORING JERRY'S REMARK LET'S SEE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON THEN SUGGESTED JOE AND THEY WENT TO FIND THE YOUNG OFFICER WHO WAS CONVALESCING FROM HIS ENCOUNTER WITH THE SPY WHEN HE HAD APPROVED THE PLAN THEY GOT THE O K OF THE CAPTAIN
4014-186176-0021.flac,TO THE THREE BOYS UNABLE TO SEE OR TALK TO EACH OTHER AND JOE AND JERRY SCARCELY DARING TO MOVE THE MINUTES LAGGED LIKE HOURS
4014-186176-0022.flac,BLACK ENDLESS NIGHTS DAWN CAME
4014-186176-0023.flac,THERE WERE MUTUAL FEELINGS OF DISAPPOINTMENT BUT NONE OF WEAKENED DETERMINATION WHAT LUCK
4014-186176-0024.flac,I WILL ARRANGE FOR ANOTHER MAN TO STAY IN THE WIRELESS ROOM DURING TO DAY
4014-186176-0025.flac,THE SEA IS CALM AND WE READILY COULD DISCERN A PERISCOPE A LONG DISTANCE AWAY TRULY IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT AND IT WAS IN THIS ALLURING QUIET OF SEEMINGLY ABSOLUTE PEACE
4014-186176-0026.flac,THE BRIGHTON BOYS AND THEIR FRIEND AND SUPERIOR OFFICER THE LIEUTENANT HAD BEEN IN THEIR APPOINTED PLACES HARDLY MORE THAN AN HOUR WHEN JOE AND JERRY AT THE SAME INSTANT CAUGHT THE SOUNDS OF SOME SORT OF SCUFFLE ON THE DECK ABOVE
4014-186176-0027.flac,IT CAME NEARER AND CLEARER UNTIL FINALLY AS IT REACHED A POINT NEAR TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRWAY UNDER WHICH JOE WAS CONCEALED THE LATTER COULD DISCERN THE FOG HORN VOICE OF THE FIRST ASSISTANT ENGINEER
4014-186176-0028.flac,THE FIRST ASSISTANT ENGINEER WAS A MIGHTY MOUNTAIN OF A MAN BUT HIS VOICE BROKE OFF AS THE COMMOTION STARTED AGAIN CERTAINLY HE MUST HAVE A ROUGH CUSTOMER TO DEAL WITH THOUGHT JERRY
4014-186176-0029.flac,YE WILL WILL YE HISSED THE VOICE OF THE ENGINEER AGAIN
4014-186176-0030.flac,YE DIRTY HOUND I'VE A MIND TO BOOT YE INTO THE SEA
4014-186176-0031.flac,AND WHIN I ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS ABOUT
4014-186176-0032.flac,SO SAID THE CAPTAIN IN A VOICE SO STERN IT MADE JOE WINCE
4014-186176-0033.flac,HE'S A THIRD CLASS MACHINIST SIR THE ENGINEER REPLIED
4014-186176-0034.flac,YES AND I BELIEVE HE'S WORSE THAN THAT THE CAPTAIN ADDED
4014-186176-0035.flac,THERE WAS A STRAINED SILENCE FOR A MOMENT THEN
4014-186176-0036.flac,IT LOOKS AS THOUGH WE'D CAUGHT THE MAN THE DOCTOR WHISPERED
4014-186176-0037.flac,THERE WAS A GASP OF ASTONISHMENT FROM JOE FOLLOWED BY A LOUDER HOLY SMOKE FROM SLIM DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN THE CAPTAIN ASKED IN A SHARP TONE I SHOULD SAY I DO SIR JOE RESPONDED
4014-186176-0038.flac,HE IS THE MAN WHO WAS PLANTING AMMUNITION IN THE WATERS NEAR THE NAVY YARD THAT NIGHT BEFORE WE SAILED THE VERY SAME ONE SIR SLIM EXCLAIMED WITH EQUAL POSITIVENESS THE SHIP'S SURGEON WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE OTHERS UPON DECK STEPPED CLOSER FOR A BETTER INSPECTION OF THIS ENEMY
4014-186176-0039.flac,AT THE SAME INSTANT THE PRISONER
4014-186176-0040.flac,AND THRUST THE ENGINEER FROM HIM BEFORE ANYONE COULD INTERFERE HE WAS DASHING DOWN THE DECK TOWARD THE STERN JUST AS HE TOOK A WILD HEADLONG LEAP OVER THE RAIL THE CAPTAIN FIRED WHILE THE CAPTAIN THROUGH A SPEAKING TUBE WAS INSTRUCTING THE MAN IN THE PILOT HOUSE TO SIGNAL BELOW REVERSE ENGINES
4014-186176-0041.flac,THE OTHERS RUSHED TO THE STERN OF THE SHIP FAR BEHIND THEM IN THE FOAMY TRAIL LEFT ON THE MOONLIT WATER BY THE VESSEL THEY SAW WHAT SEEMED TO BE THE HEAD OF A MAN BOBBING UP AND DOWN AND THEN IT ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED THE SHIP WAS TURNED
4014-186176-0042.flac,GONE SAID THE CAPTAIN IN TONES OF VERY EVIDENT RELIEF WELL IT WAS DEATH FOR HIM ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND HE TOOK HIS CHOICE AS THE CAPTAIN AND SURGEON MOVED AWAY FROM THE STERN RAIL OF THE EVERETT
4014-186176-0043.flac,AND MADE ME RUN A MILE IN NOTHING FLAT ADDED JERRY AND FOUGHT ME TO A KNOCKOUT FINISH LATER MUSED JOE AND NEARLY SMOTHERED ME TO DEATH SPOKE THE LIEUTENANT AND WAS FINALLY CORRALLED BY AN IRISH ENGINEER SAID SLIM GONE CONCLUDED JERRY
4014-186175-0000.flac,CHAPTER SEVEN THE TIMELY RESCUE IT WAS NO PLEASANT THOUGHT TO CONTEMPLATE THE PRESENCE OF A BOLD
4014-186175-0001.flac,THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF GOING ANY LENGTHS IF NECESSARY ALREADY HAD BEEN PROVED AND THE EVIDENCE OF HIS EVIL GENIUS MIGHT COME IN HORRIBLE FORM AT ANY INSTANT NEVERTHELESS
4014-186175-0002.flac,WAS SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT JERRY AND SLIM FROM TAKING A FULL EIGHT HOURS OF MUCH NEEDED SLEEP WHILE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON JOE AND THREE OTHER OFFICERS WHOM THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN INTO HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE MATTER FOLLOWED OUT EVERY POSSIBLE CLUE IN PURSUIT OF A SOLUTION OF THE BAFFLING MYSTERY
4014-186175-0003.flac,IT WAS A CASE OF WATCH EVERYBODY TAKE EVERY PRECAUTION AND BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING ONLY NINE MEN ON THE VESSEL HOWEVER INCLUDING THE SPY HIMSELF KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
4014-186175-0004.flac,REFRESHED BY THEIR SLEEP JERRY AND SLIM AROSE ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK THAT AFTERNOON JOE WHO HAD RESTED EASILY THROUGHOUT THE LATER EXCITEMENT OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT WAS STILL IN THE MIDST OF THE INVESTIGATION AND WAS NOT THEN TO BE FOUND
4014-186175-0005.flac,JERRY HAD SOME LETTERS TO WRITE SO SLIM WENT TO THE UPPER DECK ALONE
4014-186175-0006.flac,AND HIS MIND WEIGHTED ANYWAY WITH THE MENACING MYSTERY OF THE STRANGE HAPPENINGS OF THE NIGHT BEFORE HE SAT DOWN ON A COIL OF ROPE JUST IN THE LEE OF THE FORWARD SMOKESTACK TO THINK THE WHOLE MATTER OVER FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME HE WAS THUS ABSORBED WHEN SOMETHING AT FIRST VAGUE AND INDEFINITE THEN CLEARER
4014-186175-0007.flac,LIKE THE AWAKENING CALL THAT COMES TO A MAN IN A SOUND SLEEP
4014-186175-0008.flac,TO FIND SOMEONE STANDING DIRECTLY OVER HIM LOUDLY AND INSISTENTLY CALLING HIS NAME
4014-186175-0009.flac,A CRACKLING MERELY FROM THE PRESSURE WITHIN FOR A MOMENT SLIM THOUGHT AN OVER WROUGHT IMAGINATION WAS PLAYING TRICKS UPON HIM BUT HE ROSE HASTILY AND CROSSED THE SHORT INTERVENING DISTANCE
4014-186175-0010.flac,WAS RAPPING DESPERATELY UPON THAT PIPE AND IN THE LONG AND SHORT DASHES OF THE INTERNATIONAL CODE THAT SOMEONE WAS REPEATING A SINGLE WORD HELP HELP HELP IN ANOTHER INSTANT USING THE HEAVY END OF HIS JACKKNIFE AS A CRUDE TRANSMITTER SLIM WAS TAPPING OFF THE REPLY
4014-186175-0011.flac,WHO ARE YOU AND WHERE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON THE MESSAGE BEGAN TO COME BACK
4014-186175-0012.flac,CAN'T MAKE SELF HEARD CAN YOU HELP THIS IS SLIM THE YOUTH RAPPED BACK UPON THE PIPE CAUGHT YOUR MESSAGE ON DECK AM COMING WITH HELP AT ONCE AND HE DASHED DOWN THE DECK TOWARD THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS ALMOST BOWLING OVER THE CAPTAIN'S AIDE AS HE HURTLED INTO THE SANCTUM OF THE SHIP'S COMMANDER UNANNOUNCED
4014-186175-0013.flac,WELL THE CAPTAIN DEMANDED STERNLY WHY ALL THE HASTE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON SLIM BLURTED OUT HE'S LOCKED IN A CLOSET DOWN NEAR THE ENGINE ROOM LOCKED IN A CLOSET THE CAPTAIN REPEATED INCREDULOUSLY HOW DO YOU KNOW
4014-186175-0014.flac,HE GAVE A TELEGRAPHIC CALL FOR HELP ON THE STEAM PIPE WHICH RUNS THROUGH THERE AND CONNECTS WITH THE WHISTLE THE LAD EXPLAINED I WAS ON DECK AND HEARD IT I TALKED WITH HIM OVER THE PIPE THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE THEN COME WITH ME AND THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF HURRIEDLY LED THE WAY DOWN THROUGH THE LOWER DEPTHS OF THE SHIP
4014-186175-0015.flac,FOR A FEW STEPS THEY FELT THEIR WAY ALONG AND THEN STOPPED TO LISTEN THERE WAS NOTHING BUT THE DULL AND CONSTANT HUM OF THE ENGINES AND THE ALMOST INSUFFERABLE HEAT
4014-186175-0016.flac,THEY STOOD SILENT A MOMENT AND THEN FAINT AND INDISTINCT APPARENTLY FROM SOMEWHERE SEVERAL FEET AHEAD OF THEM THEY BOTH HEARD REPEATED THAT WHICH HAD MADE SLIM STOP
4014-186175-0017.flac,THE LAD REPEATED THEM FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE CAPTAIN
4014-186175-0018.flac,M O T H E R I N G
4014-186175-0019.flac,AND HE STARTED DOWN THE PASSAGEWAY TOWARD A NARROW STAIRS LEADING TO A STILL LOWER CHAMBER IN THE VESSEL THREE TURNS TWO TO THE RIGHT AND ONE TO THE LEFT AND THE CAPTAIN STOPPED AGAIN TO LISTEN SEEMINGLY FROM WITHIN THE WALL RIGHT AT THEIR ELBOWS THERE CAME A FEEBLE KNOCK
4014-186175-0020.flac,THE OFFICER WHIPPED OUT A POCKET FLASHLIGHT THEY WERE DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF A HEAVY WOODEN DOOR IT WAS LOCKED
4014-186175-0021.flac,AND SLIM HASTENED AWAY TO RETURN TWO MINUTES LATER WITH ALL THREE TOOLS
4014-186175-0022.flac,BUT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM WITHIN
4014-186175-0023.flac,TWO MORE ATTEMPTS AND THE PANEL FELL IN STRIPS TO THE FLOOR THUS GIVEN SOMETHING FOR A GRIP HOLD THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS A MASSIVE MAN TOOK HOLD WITH BOTH HANDS
4014-186175-0024.flac,BROUGHT THE ENTIRE DOOR FROM ITS HINGES
4014-186175-0025.flac,THE UNCONSCIOUS FORM OF LIEUTENANT MACKINSON TUMBLED OUT UPON THE FLOOR HIS FACE WAS ALMOST BLUE FROM SUFFOCATION THE CAPTAIN SOUNDED THREE SHORT SHARP BLASTS UPON A WHISTLE WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FROM HIS POCKET AND TWO OILERS CAME RUNNING TO THE SPOT
4014-186175-0026.flac,HELP US CARRY THIS MAN TO FRESH AIR IMMEDIATELY HE ORDERED HE HAS BEEN OVERCOME
4014-186175-0027.flac,HE HAD RELAPSED AGAIN AND THERE WAS ANOTHER WAIT OF SEVERAL MINUTES BUT THIS TIME THE LIEUTENANT'S MIND WAS CLEARING SOMEBODY SHOVED ME IN THAT CLOSET HE GASPED AND THEN SLAMMED AND LOCKED THE DOOR HE RECOGNIZED THE CAPTAIN AND THE DOCTOR
4014-186175-0028.flac,FOUND HIM LOCKED IN A SMALL COMPARTMENT DOWN NEAR THE AUXILIARY ENGINE ROOM THE COMMANDER SAID BRIEFLY
4014-186175-0029.flac,HE MADE HIS WHEREABOUTS KNOWN BY TAPPING A MESSAGE ON A STEAM PIPE
4014-186175-0030.flac,NEARLY SUFFOCATED TOO
4014-186175-0031.flac,HIS HEART ACTION IS PRETTY WEAK EVEN YET
4014-186175-0032.flac,AT THAT MOMENT JERRY CAME HURRYING DOWN THE DECK HE WAS VISIBLY EXCITED BUT
4014-186175-0033.flac,AND SO EVEN AS TWO MEN CARRIED LIEUTENANT MACKINSON AWAY HE REMAINED STANDING AT SALUTE WAITING FOR THE CAPTAIN TO RECOGNIZE HIM WITH A RETURN OF THE SALUTE AND NOW WHAT ASKED THE CAPTAIN JERRY STEPPED FORWARD WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSING HIS EXCITEMENT
4014-186175-0034.flac,WHEN I RETURNED I FOUND THIS LYING UPON THE TABLE HE OPENED HIS LEFT HAND IN IT LAY A PIECE OF LIGHT CHAIN BOTH ENDS BROKEN BESIDE IT HE CONTINUED WAS THIS NOTE FROM HIS POCKET HE EXTRACTED A PIECE OF PAPER THE EDGES OF WHICH WERE ROUGHLY TORN
4014-186175-0035.flac,LET THIS BE A WARNING THAT NO FURTHER INTERFERENCE WILL BE OF AVAIL THE CAPTAIN LOOKED FROM THE NOTE TO THE CHAIN
4014-186175-0036.flac,AND NO SIGNATURE I BELIEVE SIR SAID JERRY
4014-186175-0037.flac,THE SENIOR OFFICER OF THE VESSEL TOOK FROM HIS POCKET THE CROSS WITH ITS TWO BITS OF CHAIN STILL DANGLING FROM IT HE PLACED THE ENDS TO THE CHAIN WHICH JERRY HAD FOUND IN THE WIRELESS ROOM YOU ARE RIGHT HE SAID SIMPLY AND THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT
4014-186175-0038.flac,APPEARED EQUALLY ANXIOUS A MAN IS DISCOVERED AT NIGHT IN THE BATTERY ROOM OF THE WIRELESS DEPARTMENT OF THIS SHIP CLEARLY UPON AN UNFRIENDLY MISSION SAID THE CAPTAIN HALF TO HIMSELF AND HALF FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE OTHERS SUMMING UP THE EVIDENCE THUS FAR KNOWN TO THEM
4014-186175-0039.flac,A FEW HOURS LATER THAT SAME NIGHT HE RETURNS TO THE BATTERY ROOM AND SUCCEEDS IN RECOVERING THE PORTABLE INSTRUMENT TO DAY LIEUTENANT MACKINSON WHILE PURSUING AN INVESTIGATION OF THE AFFAIR
4014-186175-0040.flac,IS SHOVED INTO A CLOSET AND ONLY ESCAPES DEATH FROM SUFFOCATION BY MAKING HIMSELF HEARD AS HE TELEGRAPHS FOR HELP OVER A STEAM PIPE IT MUST HAVE BEEN WHILE WE WERE RESCUING THE LIEUTENANT THAT THE SAME MAN AGAIN ENTERS THE WIRELESS ROOM AND LEAVES THERE THIS CHAIN
4014-186175-0041.flac,WE ARE NOT SAFE WHILE HE IS FREE
7078-271888-0000.flac,WOMAN'S VANITY OFTEN OUTRUNS HER NATURAL DIFFIDENCE AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER GREAT BEAUTY STIFLES THE CONSCIENCE OF MODESTY VISITORS TO THE ACADEMY KNOW THE PICTURE CIRCE SEATED
7078-271888-0001.flac,WITH HER BACK TO A GREAT CIRCULAR MIRROR PRESENTS A HALF DRAPED FIGURE OF MARVELLOUS DELICATE COLOURING AND BEAUTY OF OUTLINE ONE HAND HOLDS ALOFT A GOLDEN WINE GOBLET AND THE OTHER A TAPERING WAND
7078-271888-0002.flac,WHILE UPON THE TESSELATED PAVEMENT BEFORE THE DAIS PURPLE GRAPES AND YELLOW ROSES HAVE BEEN STREWN THE BLACK HAIR OF THE DAUGHTER OF PERSEIS FALLS IN PROFUSION ABOUT HER BARE SHOULDERS AND STRAYS OVER HER BREAST
7078-271888-0003.flac,BUT HER FEATURES ARE HIDDEN BY A HALF MASK OF BLACK SILK THE LIPS WITH THEIR ARC DE CUPIDON ARE SLIGHTLY PARTED DISCLOSING AN EVEN ROW OF PEARLY TEETH
7078-271888-0004.flac,OF THE THOUSANDS WHO HAVE GAZED UPON IT IN ADMIRATION NONE KNOWS THE SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE STORY CONNECTED WITH IT AS I HAVE BEEN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH IT FROM THE DAY IT WAS OUTLINED IN CHARCOAL
7078-271888-0005.flac,UNTIL THE EVENING IT WAS PACKED IN A CRATE AND SENT FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE HANGING COMMITTEE IT IS PERHAPS APROPOS THAT I SHOULD RELATE THE NARRATIVE THE STUDIO OF MY OLD FRIEND DICK CARRUTHERS THE MAN WHO PAINTED IT
7078-271888-0006.flac,IS ON CAMPDEN HILL KENSINGTON WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF WHERE I RESIDE AND IN THE CENTRE OF AN AESTHETIC ARTISTIC COLONY WE HAVE BEEN CHUMS FOR YEARS FOR ON MANY OCCASIONS HE HAS DISPLAYED HIS TALENT AS A BLACK AND WHITE ARTIST
7078-271888-0007.flac,IN ILLUSTRATING MY ARTICLES AND STORIES IN VARIOUS MAGAZINES HE IS A POPULAR PAINTER AND AS HANDSOME A MAN AS EVER HAD A PICTURE ON THE LINE THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE PROLOGUE OF THIS SECRET DRAMA WAS ENACTED
7078-271888-0008.flac,HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF COMING OVER WHEN THE LIGHT HAD FADED TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE AND DISCUSS ART AND LITERATURE WITH ME I WAS GLAD OF A CHAT AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK AT MY WRITING TABLE BUT HIS COMPANIONSHIP HAD ONE DRAWBACK
7078-271888-0009.flac,HE DRIVELLED OVER A GIRL HE LOVED AND WAS FOREVER SUGGESTING THAT I MIGHT TAKE HER AS A CHARACTER AND DRAG HER INTO THE NOVEL UPON WHICH I WAS ENGAGED ONE DAY HE DREW A CABINET PHOTOGRAPH CAREFULLY FROM HIS POCKET
7078-271888-0010.flac,AND PLACED IT UPON THE BLOTTING PAD BEFORE ME THE GIRL HE LOVED BAH I KNEW HER THOUGH I DID NOT TELL HIM SO SHE WAS A DARK HAIRED PINK AND WHITE BEAUTY THAT FLITTED THROUGH ARTISTIC BOHEMIA LIKE A BUTTERFLY IN A HOTHOUSE
7078-271888-0011.flac,THE SIGHT OF THE PICTURED FACE BROUGHT BACK TO ME THE MEMORY OF DAYS LONG PAST OF A CLOSED CHAPTER IN MY LIFE'S HISTORY I REMEMBERED THE FIRST TIME I SAW ETHEL BROUGHTON FULLY FIVE YEARS BEFORE SHE WORE A SOILED PINK WRAPPER
7078-271888-0012.flac,HER SATIN SLIPPERS WERE TRODDEN DOWN AT HEEL AND SHE HAD A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE AT HER ELBOW AT THAT TIME HER LOVER GRANDILOQUENT AND IMPECUNIOUS MISTER HARRY ORANMORE A BAD BUT HANDSOME ACTOR HAD BEEN UNTRUE TO HER
7078-271888-0013.flac,AND SHE A THIRD RATE ACTRESS WHO HAD AN INGENUE PART AT A STRAND THEATRE
7078-271888-0014.flac,BUT SHE SCARCELY HEEDED ME PROBABLY SHE WAS THINKING OF ORANMORE FOR SHE CLASPED HER SLIM FINGERS ROUND HER SUFFERING THROAT AND OFFERED UP AN OCCASIONAL SOB FOLLOWING IT WITH A SILENT BUT PROTRACTED DRAUGHT FROM HER GLASS
7078-271888-0015.flac,THE RESULT OF THIS INTERVIEW WAS BUT NATURAL DAZZLED BY HER BEAUTY I SYMPATHISED WITH HER ENDEAVOURED TO CHEER HER AND CONCLUDED BY FALLING VIOLENTLY IN LOVE WITH HER AT THAT TIME I WAS WRITING NUMBERS OF DRAMATIC CRITICISMS
7078-271888-0016.flac,AND I CONFESS I USED WHAT WEIGHT MY OPINIONS POSSESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF HER ADVANCEMENT IT IS NEEDLESS TO REFER TO THE SMOOTH AND UNINTERRUPTED COURSE OF OUR LOVE SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT WE WERE BOTH BOHEMIANS
7078-271888-0017.flac,AND THAT WITHIN A YEAR I HAD THE SATISFACTION OF SITTING BEFORE THE FOOTLIGHTS WATCHING HER MAKE HER DEBUT AS LEADING LADY AT A WEST END THEATRE AND A FEW DAYS LATER OF OBSERVING HER PHOTOGRAPH EXHIBITED IN SHOP WINDOWS AMONG THOSE OF OTHER STAGE BEAUTIES
7078-271888-0018.flac,BUT ALAS THOSE HALCYON DAYS WERE ALL TOO BRIEF SUDDENLY THE SCALES FELL FROM MY EYES A SCENE OCCURRED BETWEEN US AND WE PARTED TO THINK THAT SIN SHOULD LIE FOR YEARS IN THE BLOOD
7078-271888-0019.flac,JUST AS ARSENIC DOES IN A CORPSE WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT DICK CARRUTHERS WAS WASTING THE VERY HONEST AND ARDENT EMOTIONS OF HIS HEART AT THIS FEVERISH FAIRY'S SHRINE I RESOLVED TO TAKE HIM ASIDE AND WITHOUT ADMITTING THAT I KNEW HER
7078-271888-0020.flac,GIVE HIM A VERBAL DRUBBING I DID SO BUT HE BIT HIS MOUSTACHE FIERCELY AND TURNED UPON ME SHE IS CHARMING HE SAID AND I LOVE HER AH I KNOW THE TYPE
7078-271888-0021.flac,YOU KNOW NOTHING OLD FELLOW HE EXCLAIMED FLUSHING ANGRILY BUT HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
7078-271888-0022.flac,YOU SHALL SEE HER BEFORE LONG HIS GAZE GREW BRIGHT SOFT AND VAGUE AS ONE WHO CATCHES GLIMPSES OF THE FLOATING GARMENTS OF SUPERNATURAL MYSTERIES AH SHE IS LOVELY ONLY AN ARTIST CAN APPRECIATE HER BEAUTY
7078-271888-0023.flac,HEEDLESS OF EVERYTHING UNDER THE SPELL SHE HAD CAST ABOUT HIM ONE NIGHT NOT LONG AFTER I HAD EXPRESSED MY SENTIMENTS TO HIM REGARDING HIS INFATUATION I ENTERED HIS STUDIO AND FOUND HIS GODDESS SEATED BY THE FIRE WITH HER SHAPELY FEET UPON THE FENDER
7078-271888-0024.flac,AND HOLDING A LIGHTED CIGARETTE BETWEEN HER DAINTY FINGERS DICK FLUNG DOWN HIS PALETTE AND CAME FORWARD TO INTRODUCE ME HER DARK EYES MET MINE AND WE TACITLY AGREED NOT TO RECOGNISE EACH OTHER THEREFORE WE BOWED AS PERFECT STRANGERS
7078-271888-0025.flac,I CAUGHT HER GLANCING FURTIVELY AT ME UNDER HER LONG LASHES SHE HAD GROWN EVEN HANDSOMER THAN WHEN LAST I HAD SEEN HER AND WAS THE PICTURE OF THE ROMANTIC BOHEMIENNE HER DRESS WAS OF BLACK GAUZE THROUGH WHICH THE MILKY WHITENESS OF HER FIGURE SEEMED TO SHINE
7078-271888-0026.flac,YET AS SHE TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL FACE TOWARDS ME I WAS STRUCK BY THE COMPLETE EFFECT OF PHYSICAL AND MORAL FRAILTY THAT SHE PRESENTED SHE EXPRESSED PLEASURE AT MEETING ME REMARKING THAT SHE HAD READ MY LAST NOVEL AND HAD BEEN KEENLY INTERESTED IN IT
7078-271888-0027.flac,WHEN I HAD BRIEFLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPLIMENT SHE PAID ME SHE SAID ONE THING ALWAYS STRIKES ME IN READING YOUR STORIES YOUR WOMEN ARE INEVITABLY FALSE AND FICKLE PERHAPS HOWEVER YOU WRITE FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
7078-271888-0028.flac,OF THE FAILINGS OF MY SEX SHE LAUGHED GLANCING SHARPLY AT HER I SAW THAT HER EYES DID NOT WAVER IT IS TRUE I ONCE KNEW A WOMAN WHO PROVED FALSE AND INFAMOUS I REPLIED WITH SOME EMPHASIS
7078-271888-0029.flac,AND YOU AVENGE YOURSELF BY REVILING ALL OF US IT IS REALLY TOO BAD SHE SAID POUTING LIKE A SPOILED CHILD BY JOVE OLD FELLOW DICK CHIMED IN DO TELL US ABOUT YOUR ROMANCE IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW THE REASON
7078-271888-0030.flac,YOU SET YOUR FACE AGAINST ALL THE FAIR ONES BUT I SUCCEEDED IN TURNING THE CONVERSATION INTO ANOTHER CHANNEL
7078-271888-0031.flac,SO MAKING AN EXCUSE I BADE THEM AU REVOIR AND RETURNED TO MY OWN BOOK LINED DEN UNLOCKING A DRAWER IN MY WRITING TABLE I TOOK OUT A PACKET OF LETTERS THAT STILL EMITTED A STALE ODOUR OF VIOLETS
7078-271888-0032.flac,THEN I LIT MY PIPE AND ONE BY ONE READ THEM THROUGH PAUSING AND PONDERING OVER THE DECLARATIONS OF PASSIONATE LOVE THEY CONTAINED FAR INTO THE NIGHT I SAT REVIEWING THE ROMANCE OF BYGONE DAYS UNTIL I CAME TO THE LAST LETTER

7078-271888-0061.flac,HE WAS SUCH A LARGE HEARTED HONEST FELLOW THAT I FELT QUITE PAINED WHEN I ANTICIPATED THE AWAKENING THAT MUST INEVITABLY COME SOONER OR LATER HE KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OF HER PAST AND WAS QUITE IGNORANT THAT SHE HAD BEEN A POPULAR ACTRESS
7078-271888-0062.flac,IN THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED I VISITED THE STUDIO ALMOST DAILY AND WATCHED THE GROWTH OF THE PICTURE
7078-271888-0063.flac,THE DELICATE TINTS OF THE NECK AND ARMS WERE REPRODUCED WITH A SKILL THAT BETRAYED THE MASTER HAND
7078-271888-0064.flac,I RETURNED HOME FROM A STROLL ACROSS KENSINGTON GARDENS

7078-271888-0074.flac,ON THIS OCCASION AS ON PREVIOUS ONES I ASSISTED DICK TO RECEIVE HIS VISITORS BUT UNFORTUNATELY ETHEL HAD BEEN TAKEN SUDDENLY UNWELL AND COULD NOT ATTEND MY ANTICIPATIONS PROVED CORRECT
7078-271888-0075.flac,THE OPINIONS OF CRITICS WHO DROPPED IN WERE UNANIMOUS THAT IT WAS THE ARTIST'S MASTERPIECE AND THAT THE EXPRESSION AND GENERAL CONCEPTION WERE MARVELLOUS A VERDICT ENDORSED BY GUSHING SOCIETY WOMEN BORED CLUB MEN AND THE INANE JEUNESSE DOREE
7078-271888-0076.flac,A SCRAP OF CONVERSATION I OVERHEARD IN THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON HOWEVER CAUSED ME TO PONDER AN ELDERLY MAN EVIDENTLY A FOREIGNER WEARING THE VIOLET RIBBON OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY IN HIS BUTTONHOLE

7078-271888-0080.flac,IN SURPRISE I GLANCED UP FROM MY WORK OF ROMANCE WEAVING ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND SAW DICK PALE AND AGITATED STANDING AT MY ELBOW THE LETTER HE PLACED BEFORE ME WAS IN A WOMAN'S HAND AND EMITTED THE FAINTEST BREATH OF VIOLETS
7078-271888-0081.flac,A GLANCE WAS SUFFICIENT TO RECOGNISE THAT THE SPRAWLY WRITING WAS ETHEL'S TAKING IT UP I EAGERLY READ THE FOLLOWING LINES IT CONTAINED DEAR DICK I REGRET TO TELL YOU THAT CIRCUMSTANCES PRECLUDE ME FROM EVER MEETING YOU AGAIN
7078-271888-0082.flac,I AM GOING FAR AWAY WHERE YOU CANNOT FIND ME IT WAS FOOLISH FOR US TO HAVE LOVED THEREFORE FORGET ME THAT YOU MAY MEET SOME ONE FAR WORTHIER THAN MYSELF

7078-271888-0084.flac,WHILE HIS FACE ASSUMED A HARD DETERMINED EXPRESSION
7078-271888-0085.flac,AND SHE HAD HER FOOT UPON MY NECK BUT IT IS ALL OVER HE ADDED BITTERLY I SHALL THINK NO MORE OF HER THEN HE WISHED ME AN ABRUPT FAREWELL AND LEFT
7078-271888-0086.flac,THAT EVENING I CALLED AT DICK'S HOUSE BUT WAS INFORMED BY HIS HOUSEKEEPER THAT HE HAD PACKED HIS BAG AND DEPARTED STATING THAT HE WOULD NOT RETURN FOR AT LEAST A MONTH PERHAPS LONGER WHEN I ENTERED THE STUDIO GLOOMY IN THE TWILIGHT
7078-271888-0087.flac,AND THAT IT WAS STANDING IN A CORNER WITH ITS FACE TO THE WALL
7078-271888-0088.flac,AND WHEN I DID SO I DISCOVERED TO MY DISMAY THAT IN HIS FRENZY OF MAD DESPAIR
7078-271888-0089.flac,AND DRAWN IT ACROSS THE FACE MAKING A GREAT UGLY DISFIGURING DAUB OVER THE FOREHEAD AND EYEBROWS UTTERLY RUINING THE FEATURES AND PRODUCING A CURIOUSLY FORBIDDING EFFECT THE COLOUR WAS NOT DRY
7078-271888-0090.flac,THEREFORE I WAS ENABLED TO REMOVE THE GREATER PORTION OF IT WITH A SILK HANDKERCHIEF BUT I SAW WITH REGRET THAT THE TINTS OF THE FOREHEAD HAD BEEN IRRETRIEVABLY RUINED RENDERING THE PICTURE VALUELESS THE DAYS WENT BY
7078-271888-0091.flac,THE LIMIT FOR SENDING IN TO THE ACADEMY WAS APPROACHING BUT DICK DID NOT WRITE AND I COULD ONLY WONDER VAGUELY WHERE HE WAS WANDERING IT WAS A GREAT PITY I THOUGHT THAT SUCH A FINE WORK SHOULD NOT BE EXHIBITED
7078-271888-0092.flac,YET THE WILFUL OBLITERATION HAD UTTERLY SPOILED IT WHILE SITTING IN HIS STUDIO MUSING ONE DAY IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT IF THE FLAW UPON THE FOREHEAD COULD BE HIDDEN IT MIGHT AFTER ALL BE SENT FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE HANGING COMMITTEE
7078-271888-0093.flac,TAKING IT UP I EXAMINED IT MINUTELY IN THE LIGHT THE IDEA OF PLACING A HALF MASK UPON THE FACE SUGGESTED ITSELF AND WITHOUT DELAY I PROCEEDED TO CARRY IT INTO EFFECT
7078-271888-0094.flac,ENABLED ME TO PAINT IN THE HALF LIGHTS UPON THE BLACK SILK AND THE LAUGHING EYES BEING FORTUNATELY INTACT I ALLOWED THEM TO PEER THROUGH THE APERTURES THE EFFECT PRODUCED WAS STARTLING
7078-271888-0095.flac,THE MASK SEEMED TO INCREASE THE RECKLESS DIABLERIE OF ITS WEARER AND ENHANCE THE FAIRNESS OF THE COMPLEXION WHILE IT ADDED AN AIR OF MYSTERY NOT AT ALL UNPLEASING TO THE EYE A FEW DAYS LATER I DISPATCHED IT TO THE ACADEMY
7078-271888-0096.flac,AND WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE OPENING DAY WHEN I EXPERIENCED THE MINGLED SURPRISE AND SATISFACTION OF SEEING IT HUNG UPON THE LINE
7078-271888-0097.flac,WAS PRONOUNCED ONE OF THE PICTURES OF THE YEAR THOUSANDS ADMIRED IT THE PAPERS WERE FULL OF LAUDATORY NOTICES BUT THE MAN WHO PAINTED IT UNAWARE OF THE FAME HE HAD SUDDENLY ACHIEVED WAS HIDING HIS SORROW SOMEWHERE IN THE VOSGES
7078-271888-0098.flac,A STRAY COPY OF AN ENGLISH NEWSPAPER CONTAINING A NOTICE OF HIS WORK WHICH DICK PICKED UP IN A HOTEL HOWEVER CAUSED HIM TO RETURN HE BURST INTO MY ROOM UNCEREMONIOUSLY ONE MORNING STILL ATTIRED IN HIS TRAVELLING ULSTER
7078-271888-0099.flac,I SAW THAT HE WAS HAGGARD EYED AND WILD LOOKING FROM HIS CONVERSATION I KNEW THAT TIME HAD NOT HEALED THE WOUND IN HIS HEART I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO THANK YOU SUFFICIENTLY OLD CHAP FOR TOUCHING UP MY DAUB

4195-186236-0003.flac,BUT BEING UNAWARE OF ITS IMPORT GAVE IT BUT PASSING ATTENTION THE MAIN SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION WAS AUNT JANE'S SURPRISING ACT IN ANNULLING HER LAST WILL AND FORCING PATRICIA TO ACCEPT THE INHERITANCE WHEN SHE DID NOT WANT IT
4195-186236-0004.flac,WHEN ALONE WITH THE THREE COUSINS PROTESTED THAT IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT FOR PATSY TO GIVE HIM ALL THE ESTATE BUT AS SHE WAS SO GENEROUS HE WOULD ACCEPT ENOUGH OF HIS UNCLE TOM'S MONEY TO EDUCATE HIM AS AN ARTIST AND PROVIDE FOR HIMSELF AN HUMBLE HOME

6880-216547-0000.flac,THE FOLLOWING LETTER SERVED AS A PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS MEMOIR
6880-216547-0001.flac,PARIS JUNE THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN FORTY GENTLEMEN IN THE COURSE OF YOUR DEBATE OF THE NINTH OF MAY EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE IN REGARD TO THE TRIENNIAL PENSION ESTABLISHED BY MADAME SUARD
6880-216547-0002.flac,YOU EXPRESSED THE FOLLOWING WISH THE ACADEMY REQUESTS THE TITULARY TO PRESENT IT ANNUALLY DURING THE FIRST FORTNIGHT IN JULY WITH A SUCCINCT AND LOGICAL STATEMENT OF THE VARIOUS STUDIES WHICH HE HAS PURSUED DURING THE YEAR
6880-216547-0003.flac,WHICH HAS JUST EXPIRED I NOW PROPOSE GENTLEMEN TO DISCHARGE THIS DUTY
6880-216547-0004.flac,WHEN I SOLICITED YOUR VOTES I BOLDLY AVOWED MY INTENTION TO BEND MY EFFORTS TO THE DISCOVERY OF SOME MEANS OF AMELIORATING THE PHYSICAL
6880-216547-0005.flac,MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL CONDITION OF THE MERE NUMEROUS AND POORER CLASSES THIS IDEA FOREIGN AS IT MAY HAVE SEEMED TO THE OBJECT OF MY CANDIDACY YOU RECEIVED FAVORABLY
6880-216547-0006.flac,YOU CHANGED THIS FORMAL OFFER INTO AN INVIOLABLE AND SACRED OBLIGATION THENCEFORTH I UNDERSTOOD WITH HOW WORTHY AND HONORABLE A SOCIETY I HAD TO DEAL MY REGARD FOR ITS ENLIGHTENMENT MY RECOGNITION OF ITS BENEFITS
6880-216547-0007.flac,MY ENTHUSIASM FOR ITS GLORY WERE UNBOUNDED CONVINCED AT ONCE THAT IN ORDER TO BREAK LOOSE FROM THE BEATEN PATHS OF OPINIONS AND SYSTEMS IT WAS NECESSARY TO PROCEED IN MY STUDY OF MAN AND SOCIETY
6880-216547-0008.flac,BY SCIENTIFIC METHODS AND IN A RIGOROUS MANNER I DEVOTED ONE YEAR TO PHILOLOGY AND GRAMMAR LINGUISTICS OR THE NATURAL HISTORY OF SPEECH BEING OF ALL THE SCIENCES THAT
6880-216547-0009.flac,SEEMED TO BEAR THE CLOSEST RELATION TO THE RESEARCHES WHICH I WAS ABOUT TO COMMENCE
6880-216547-0010.flac,IF IT DID NOT REVEAL THE ASTONISHING SUCCESS AT LEAST BORE WITNESS TO THE THOROUGHNESS OF MY LABORS SINCE THAT TIME METAPHYSICS AND MORAL SCIENCE HAVE BEEN MY ONLY STUDIES
6880-216547-0011.flac,MY PERCEPTION OF THE FACT THAT THESE SCIENCES THOUGH BADLY DEFINED AS TO THEIR OBJECT AND NOT CONFINED TO THEIR SPHERE ARE LIKE THE NATURAL SCIENCES SUSCEPTIBLE OF DEMONSTRATION AND CERTAINTY
6880-216547-0012.flac,HAS ALREADY REWARDED MY EFFORTS BUT GENTLEMEN OF ALL THE MASTERS WHOM I HAVE FOLLOWED TO NONE DO I OWE SO MUCH AS TO YOU
6880-216547-0013.flac,YOUR CO OPERATION YOUR PROGRAMMES YOUR INSTRUCTIONS IN AGREEMENT WITH MY SECRET WISHES AND MOST CHERISHED HOPES HAVE AT NO TIME FAILED TO ENLIGHTEN ME AND TO POINT OUT MY ROAD THIS MEMOIR ON PROPERTY
6880-216547-0014.flac,IS THE CHILD OF YOUR THOUGHT
6880-216547-0015.flac,TO WHAT CAUSES MUST WE ATTRIBUTE THE CONTINUALLY INCREASING NUMBER OF SUICIDES AND WHAT ARE THE PROPER MEANS FOR ARRESTING THE EFFECTS OF THIS MORAL CONTAGION
6880-216547-0016.flac,THEREBY IT ASKED IN LESS GENERAL TERMS WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE SOCIAL EVIL AND WHAT WAS ITS REMEDY YOU ADMITTED THAT YOURSELVES GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0017.flac,WHEN YOUR COMMITTEE REPORTED THAT THE COMPETITORS HAD ENUMERATED WITH EXACTNESS THE IMMEDIATE AND PARTICULAR CAUSES OF SUICIDE AS WELL AS THE MEANS OF PREVENTING EACH OF THEM BUT THAT FROM THIS ENUMERATION
6880-216547-0018.flac,CHRONICLED WITH MORE OR LESS SKILL NO POSITIVE INFORMATION HAD BEEN GAINED EITHER AS TO THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE EVIL OR AS TO ITS REMEDY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
6880-216547-0019.flac,YOUR PROGRAMME ALWAYS ORIGINAL AND VARIED IN ITS ACADEMICAL EXPRESSION BECAME MORE EXACT THE INVESTIGATIONS OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT HAD POINTED OUT AS THE CAUSES OR RATHER AS THE SYMPTOMS OF THE SOCIAL MALADY
6880-216547-0020.flac,THE NEGLECT OF THE PRINCIPLES OF RELIGION AND MORALITY THE DESIRE FOR WEALTH THE PASSION FOR ENJOYMENT AND POLITICAL DISTURBANCES ALL THESE DATA WERE EMBODIED BY YOU IN A SINGLE PROPOSITION
6880-216547-0021.flac,THE UTILITY OF THE CELEBRATION OF SUNDAY AS REGARDS HYGIENE MORALITY AND SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RELATION IN A CHRISTIAN TONGUE YOU ASKED GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0022.flac,WHAT WAS THE TRUE SYSTEM OF SOCIETY A COMPETITOR
6880-216547-0023.flac,DARED TO MAINTAIN AND BELIEVED THAT HE HAD PROVED THAT THE INSTITUTION OF A DAY OF REST AT WEEKLY INTERVALS IS INSEPARABLY BOUND UP WITH A POLITICAL SYSTEM BASED ON THE EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS
6880-216547-0024.flac,THAT WITHOUT EQUALITY THIS INSTITUTION IS AN ANOMALY AND AN IMPOSSIBILITY THAT EQUALITY ALONE CAN REVIVE THIS ANCIENT AND MYSTERIOUS KEEPING OF THE SEVENTH DAY
6880-216547-0025.flac,THIS ARGUMENT DID NOT MEET WITH YOUR APPROBATION SINCE WITHOUT DENYING THE RELATION POINTED OUT BY THE COMPETITOR YOU JUDGED AND RIGHTLY GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0026.flac,THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS NOT BEING DEMONSTRATED THE IDEAS OF THE AUTHOR WERE NOTHING MORE THAN HYPOTHESES FINALLY GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0027.flac,THIS FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY YOU PRESENTED FOR COMPETITION IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS
6880-216547-0028.flac,THE ECONOMICAL AND MORAL CONSEQUENCES IN FRANCE UP TO THE PRESENT TIME AND THOSE WHICH SEEM LIKELY TO APPEAR IN FUTURE OF THE LAW CONCERNING THE EQUAL DIVISION OF HEREDITARY PROPERTY BETWEEN THE CHILDREN
6880-216547-0029.flac,INSTEAD OF CONFINING ONE TO COMMON PLACES WITHOUT BREADTH OR SIGNIFICANCE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOUR QUESTION SHOULD BE DEVELOPED AS FOLLOWS
6880-216547-0030.flac,CAN IT NOT RENDER IT EQUAL FOR ALL HIS GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN IF THE LAW NO LONGER HEEDS THE AGE OF ANY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY CAN IT NOT BY THE RIGHT OF HEREDITY
6880-216547-0031.flac,CEASE TO HEED IT IN THE RACE IN THE TRIBE IN THE NATION CAN EQUALITY BY THE RIGHT OF SUCCESSION BE PRESERVED BETWEEN CITIZENS AS WELL AS BETWEEN COUSINS AND BROTHERS
6880-216547-0032.flac,IN A WORD CAN THE PRINCIPLE OF SUCCESSION BECOME A PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY TO SUM UP ALL THESE IDEAS IN ONE INCLUSIVE QUESTION WHAT IS THE PRINCIPLE OF HEREDITY
6880-216547-0033.flac,WHAT ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF INEQUALITY WHAT IS PROPERTY SUCH GENTLEMEN IS THE OBJECT OF THE MEMOIR THAT I OFFER YOU TO DAY
6880-216547-0034.flac,IF I HAVE RIGHTLY GRASPED THE OBJECT OF YOUR THOUGHT IF I SUCCEED IN BRINGING TO LIGHT A TRUTH WHICH IS INDISPUTABLE BUT FROM CAUSES WHICH I AM BOLD ENOUGH TO CLAIM TO HAVE EXPLAINED
6880-216547-0035.flac,HAS ALWAYS BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD IF BY AN INFALLIBLE METHOD OF INVESTIGATION I ESTABLISH THE DOGMA OF EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS IF I DETERMINE THE PRINCIPLE OF CIVIL LAW THE ESSENCE OF JUSTICE AND THE FORM OF SOCIETY
6880-216547-0036.flac,TO YOU GENTLEMEN WILL REDOUND ALL THE GLORY FOR IT IS TO YOUR AID AND YOUR INSPIRATION THAT I OWE IT MY PURPOSE IN THIS WORK IS THE APPLICATION OF METHOD
6880-216547-0037.flac,TO THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY EVERY OTHER INTENTION IS FOREIGN TO AND EVEN ABUSIVE OF IT I HAVE SPOKEN LIGHTLY OF JURISPRUDENCE I HAD THE RIGHT
6880-216547-0038.flac,BUT I SHOULD BE UNJUST DID I NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THIS PRETENDED SCIENCE AND THE MEN WHO PRACTISE IT DEVOTED TO STUDIES BOTH LABORIOUS AND SEVERE
6880-216547-0039.flac,ENTITLED IN ALL RESPECTS TO THE ESTEEM OF THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS BY THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND ELOQUENCE OUR LEGISTS DESERVE BUT ONE REPROACH THAT OF AN EXCESSIVE DEFERENCE TO ARBITRARY LAWS
6880-216547-0040.flac,AND THEIR UNWARRANTED BLUNDERS HAVE DISGUSTED ME WHOEVER KNOWING THEM PARDONS THEM MAY READ THEM I HAVE SEVERELY BLAMED THE LEARNED CHRISTIAN CHURCH
6880-216547-0041.flac,IT WAS MY DUTY THIS BLAME RESULTS FROM THE FACTS WHICH I CALL ATTENTION TO WHY HAS THE CHURCH DECREED CONCERNING THINGS WHICH IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
6880-216547-0042.flac,THE CHURCH HAS ERRED IN DOGMA AND IN MORALS PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TESTIFY AGAINST HER IT MAY BE WRONG FOR ME TO SAY IT BUT SURELY IT IS UNFORTUNATE FOR CHRISTIANITY THAT IT IS TRUE
6880-216547-0043.flac,TO RESTORE RELIGION GENTLEMEN IT IS NECESSARY TO CONDEMN THE CHURCH PERHAPS YOU WILL REGRET GENTLEMEN THAT IN GIVING ALL MY ATTENTION TO METHOD AND EVIDENCE
6880-216547-0044.flac,I HAVE TOO MUCH NEGLECTED FORM AND STYLE IN VAIN SHOULD I HAVE TRIED TO DO BETTER LITERARY HOPE AND FAITH I HAVE NONE
6880-216547-0045.flac,THAT IS THE REASON IN MY OPINION WHY AMONG SO MANY MEN OF TALENT FRANCE TO DAY COUNTS NOT ONE GREAT WRITER
6880-216547-0046.flac,IN A SOCIETY LIKE OURS TO SEEK FOR LITERARY GLORY SEEMS TO ME AN ANACHRONISM OF WHAT USE IS IT TO INVOKE AN ANCIENT SIBYL WHEN A MUSE IS ON THE EVE OF BIRTH
6880-216547-0047.flac,PITIABLE ACTORS IN A TRAGEDY NEARING ITS END THAT WHICH IT BEHOOVES US TO DO IS TO PRECIPITATE THE CATASTROPHE THE MOST DESERVING AMONG US IS HE WHO PLAYS BEST THIS PART WELL
6880-216547-0048.flac,I NO LONGER ASPIRE TO THIS SAD SUCCESS WHY SHOULD I NOT CONFESS IT GENTLEMEN I HAVE ASPIRED TO YOUR SUFFRAGES AND SOUGHT THE TITLE OF YOUR PENSIONER HATING ALL WHICH EXISTS AND FULL OF PROJECTS FOR ITS DESTRUCTION
6880-216547-0049.flac,AND THE MOST PRECIOUS FRUIT THAT I COULD WISH TO GATHER FROM THIS MEMOIR WOULD BE THE INSPIRATION OF MY READERS WITH THAT TRANQUILLITY OF SOUL WHICH ARISES FROM THE CLEAR PERCEPTION OF EVIL AND ITS CAUSE
6880-216547-0050.flac,AND WHICH IS MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN PASSION AND ENTHUSIASM MY HATRED OF PRIVILEGE AND HUMAN AUTHORITY WAS UNBOUNDED PERHAPS AT TIMES I HAVE BEEN GUILTY IN MY INDIGNATION
6880-216547-0051.flac,OF CONFOUNDING PERSONS AND THINGS AT PRESENT I CAN ONLY DESPISE AND COMPLAIN TO CEASE TO HATE I ONLY NEEDED TO KNOW
6880-216547-0052.flac,IT IS FOR YOU NOW GENTLEMEN WHOSE MISSION AND CHARACTER ARE THE PROCLAMATION OF THE TRUTH IT IS FOR YOU TO INSTRUCT THE PEOPLE AND TO TELL THEM FOR WHAT THEY OUGHT TO HOPE
6880-216547-0053.flac,AND WHAT THEY OUGHT TO FEAR THE PEOPLE INCAPABLE AS YET OF SOUND JUDGMENT AS TO WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM APPLAUD INDISCRIMINATELY THE MOST OPPOSITE IDEAS PROVIDED THAT IN THEM THEY GET A TASTE OF FLATTERY
6880-216547-0054.flac,TO THEM THE LAWS OF THOUGHT ARE LIKE THE CONFINES OF THE POSSIBLE TO DAY THEY CAN NO MORE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A SAVANT AND A SOPHIST THAN FORMERLY THEY COULD TELL A PHYSICIAN FROM A SORCERER
6880-216547-0055.flac,INCONSIDERATELY ACCEPTING GATHERING TOGETHER AND ACCUMULATING EVERYTHING THAT IS NEW REGARDING ALL REPORTS AS TRUE
6880-216547-0056.flac,THEY ASSEMBLE LIKE BEES AT THE SOUND OF A BASIN
6880-216547-0057.flac,MAY YOU GENTLEMEN DESIRE EQUALITY AS I MYSELF DESIRE IT MAY YOU FOR THE ETERNAL HAPPINESS OF OUR COUNTRY BECOME ITS PROPAGATORS AND ITS HERALDS
6880-216547-0058.flac,MAY I BE THE LAST OF YOUR PENSIONERS OF ALL THE WISHES THAT I CAN FRAME THAT GENTLEMEN IS THE MOST WORTHY OF YOU AND THE MOST HONORABLE FOR ME
6880-216547-0059.flac,TWO MONTHS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THIS LETTER THE ACADEMY IN ITS DEBATE OF AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH REPLIED TO THE ADDRESS OF ITS PENSIONER BY A NOTE THE TEXT OF WHICH I GIVE BELOW
6880-216547-0060.flac,PUBLISHED LAST JUNE BY THE TITULARY OF THE SUARD PENSION ENTITLED WHAT IS PROPERTY AND DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR TO THE ACADEMY HE IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE SOCIETY OWES IT TO JUSTICE
6880-216547-0061.flac,TO EXAMPLE AND TO ITS OWN DIGNITY TO PUBLICLY DISAVOW ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ANTI SOCIAL DOCTRINES CONTAINED IN THIS PUBLICATION IN CONSEQUENCE HE DEMANDS
6880-216547-0062.flac,IN THE MOST FORMAL MANNER THE WORK OF THE SUARD PENSIONER AS HAVING BEEN PUBLISHED WITHOUT ITS ASSENT AND AS ATTRIBUTING TO IT OPINIONS DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO THE PRINCIPLES OF EACH OF ITS MEMBERS
6880-216547-0063.flac,IN CASE HE SHOULD PUBLISH A SECOND EDITION OF HIS BOOK TO OMIT THE DEDICATION
6880-216547-0064.flac,THAT THIS JUDGMENT OF THE ACADEMY BE PLACED UPON THE RECORDS THESE THREE PROPOSITIONS PUT TO VOTE ARE ADOPTED
6880-216547-0065.flac,AFTER THIS LUDICROUS DECREE WHICH ITS AUTHORS THOUGHT TO RENDER POWERFUL BY GIVING IT THE FORM OF A CONTRADICTION
6880-216547-0066.flac,I CAN ONLY BEG THE READER NOT TO MEASURE THE INTELLIGENCE OF MY COMPATRIOTS BY THAT OF OUR ACADEMY WHILE MY PATRONS IN THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES WERE FULMINATING ANATHEMAS AGAINST MY BROCHURE
6880-216547-0067.flac,WHO DID NOT KNOW ME WHO MIGHT EVEN HAVE REGARDED HIMSELF AS PERSONALLY ATTACKED BY THE TOO SHARP JUDGMENT WHICH I HAD PASSED UPON THE ECONOMISTS A PUBLICIST AS LEARNED AS HE WAS MODEST LOVED BY THE PEOPLE WHOSE SORROWS HE FELT
6880-216547-0068.flac,HONORED BY THE POWER WHICH HE SOUGHT TO ENLIGHTEN WITHOUT FLATTERING OR DISGRACING IT
6880-216547-0069.flac,MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL ECONOMY DEFENDER OF PROPERTY TOOK UP MY DEFENCE BEFORE HIS ASSOCIATES AND BEFORE THE MINISTRY
6880-216547-0070.flac,AND SAVED ME FROM THE BLOWS OF A JUSTICE WHICH IS ALWAYS BLIND BECAUSE IT IS ALWAYS IGNORANT
6880-216547-0071.flac,A LETTER AS HONORABLE TO ITS AUTHOR AS IT IS FLATTERING TO HIM TO WHOM IT IS ADDRESSED PARIS MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE MONSIEUR
6880-216547-0072.flac,I HASTEN TO THANK YOU FOR FORWARDING TO ME YOUR SECOND MEMOIR UPON PROPERTY I HAVE READ IT WITH ALL THE INTEREST THAT AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FIRST WOULD NATURALLY INSPIRE I AM VERY GLAD THAT YOU HAVE MODIFIED SOMEWHAT
6880-216547-0073.flac,THE RUDENESS OF FORM WHICH GAVE TO A WORK OF SUCH GRAVITY THE MANNER AND APPEARANCE OF A PAMPHLET FOR YOU QUITE FRIGHTENED ME SIR AND YOUR TALENT WAS NEEDED TO REASSURE ME IN REGARD TO YOUR INTENTIONS
6880-216547-0074.flac,THIS PROPOSITION NOW COMING INTO NOTICE PROPERTY IS ROBBERY WAS OF A NATURE TO REPEL FROM YOUR BOOK EVEN THOSE SERIOUS MINDS WHO DO NOT JUDGE BY APPEARANCES HAD YOU PERSISTED IN MAINTAINING IT
6880-216547-0075.flac,IN ITS RUDE SIMPLICITY BUT IF YOU HAVE SOFTENED THE FORM YOU ARE NONE THE LESS FAITHFUL TO THE GROUND WORK OF YOUR DOCTRINES AND ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE DONE ME THE HONOR TO GIVE ME A SHARE IN THIS PERILOUS TEACHING
6880-216547-0076.flac,I CANNOT ACCEPT A PARTNERSHIP WHICH AS FAR AS TALENT GOES WOULD SURELY BE A CREDIT TO ME BUT WHICH WOULD COMPROMISE ME IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS I AGREE WITH YOU IN ONE THING ONLY
6880-216547-0077.flac,NAMELY THAT ALL KINDS OF PROPERTY GET TOO FREQUENTLY ABUSED IN THIS WORLD BUT I DO NOT REASON FROM THE ABUSE TO THE ABOLITION AN HEROIC REMEDY TOO MUCH LIKE DEATH
6880-216547-0078.flac,WHICH CURES ALL EVILS I WILL GO FARTHER I WILL CONFESS THAT OF ALL ABUSES THE MOST HATEFUL TO ME ARE THOSE OF PROPERTY BUT ONCE MORE
6880-216547-0079.flac,THERE IS A REMEDY FOR THIS EVIL WITHOUT VIOLATING IT ALL THE MORE WITHOUT DESTROYING IT IF THE PRESENT LAWS ALLOW ABUSE WE CAN RECONSTRUCT THEM OUR CIVIL CODE IS NOT THE KORAN
6880-216547-0080.flac,IT IS NOT WRONG TO EXAMINE IT CHANGE THEN THE LAWS WHICH GOVERN THE USE OF PROPERTY BUT BE SPARING OF ANATHEMAS FOR LOGICALLY WHERE IS THE HONEST MAN WHOSE HANDS ARE ENTIRELY CLEAN
6880-216547-0081.flac,DO YOU THINK THAT ONE CAN BE A ROBBER WITHOUT KNOWING IT WITHOUT WISHING IT WITHOUT SUSPECTING IT DO YOU NOT ADMIT THAT SOCIETY IN ITS PRESENT STATE LIKE EVERY MAN
6880-216547-0082.flac,HAS IN ITS CONSTITUTION ALL KINDS OF VIRTUES AND VICES INHERITED FROM OUR ANCESTORS IS PROPERTY THEN IN YOUR EYES A THING SO SIMPLE AND SO ABSTRACT THAT YOU CAN RE KNEAD AND EQUALIZE IT
6880-216547-0083.flac,IF I MAY SO SPEAK IN YOUR METAPHYSICAL MILL ONE WHO HAS SAID AS MANY EXCELLENT AND PRACTICAL THINGS AS OCCUR IN THESE TWO BEAUTIFUL AND PARADOXICAL IMPROVISATIONS OF YOURS CANNOT BE A PURE AND UNWAVERING UTOPIST
6880-216547-0084.flac,YOU ARE TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE ECONOMICAL AND ACADEMICAL PHRASEOLOGY TO PLAY WITH THE HARD WORDS OF REVOLUTIONS I BELIEVE THEN THAT YOU HAVE HANDLED PROPERTY
6880-216547-0085.flac,AS ROUSSEAU EIGHTY YEARS AGO HANDLED LETTERS WITH A MAGNIFICENT AND POETICAL DISPLAY OF WIT AND KNOWLEDGE SUCH AT LEAST IS MY OPINION
6880-216547-0086.flac,THAT IS WHAT I SAID TO THE INSTITUTE AT THE TIME WHEN I PRESENTED MY REPORT UPON YOUR BOOK I KNEW THAT THEY WISHED TO PROCEED AGAINST YOU IN THE COURTS YOU PERHAPS DO NOT KNOW BY HOW NARROW A CHANCE I SUCCEEDED IN PREVENTING THEM
6880-216547-0087.flac,WHAT CHAGRIN I SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE FELT IF THE KING'S COUNSEL THAT IS TO SAY THE INTELLECTUAL EXECUTIONER HAD FOLLOWED IN MY VERY TRACKS TO ATTACK YOUR BOOK AND ANNOY YOUR PERSON
6880-216547-0088.flac,I ACTUALLY PASSED TWO TERRIBLE NIGHTS AND I SUCCEEDED IN RESTRAINING THE SECULAR ARM ONLY BY SHOWING THAT YOUR BOOK WAS AN ACADEMICAL DISSERTATION AND NOT THE MANIFESTO OF AN INCENDIARY
6880-216547-0089.flac,YOUR STYLE IS TOO LOFTY EVER TO BE OF SERVICE TO THE MADMEN WHO IN DISCUSSING THE GRAVEST QUESTIONS OF OUR SOCIAL ORDER USE PAVING STONES AS THEIR WEAPONS
6880-216547-0090.flac,BUT SEE TO IT SIR THAT ERE LONG THEY DO NOT COME IN SPITE OF YOU TO SEEK FOR AMMUNITION IN THIS FORMIDABLE ARSENAL AND THAT YOUR VIGOROUS METAPHYSICS FALLS NOT INTO THE HANDS OF SOME SOPHIST OF THE MARKET PLACE
6880-216547-0091.flac,WHO MIGHT DISCUSS THE QUESTION IN THE PRESENCE OF A STARVING AUDIENCE WE SHOULD HAVE PILLAGE FOR CONCLUSION AND PERORATION
6880-216547-0092.flac,BUT THE MAJESTIC AND IMPOSING ORDER OF HUMAN SOCIETIES THAT I SOMETIMES FIND MYSELF EMBARRASSED IN ATTACKING CERTAIN ABUSES I LIKE TO REBUILD WITH ONE HAND WHEN I AM COMPELLED TO DESTROY WITH THE OTHER
6880-216547-0093.flac,IN PRUNING AN OLD TREE WE GUARD AGAINST DESTRUCTION OF THE BUDS AND FRUIT YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL AS ANY ONE YOU ARE A WISE AND LEARNED MAN YOU HAVE A THOUGHTFUL MIND
6880-216547-0094.flac,THE TERMS BY WHICH YOU CHARACTERIZE THE FANATICS OF OUR DAY ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO REASSURE THE MOST SUSPICIOUS IMAGINATIONS AS TO YOUR INTENTIONS BUT YOU CONCLUDE
6880-216547-0095.flac,IN FAVOR OF THE ABOLITION OF PROPERTY YOU WISH TO ABOLISH THE MOST POWERFUL MOTOR OF THE HUMAN MIND YOU ATTACK THE PATERNAL SENTIMENT IN ITS SWEETEST ILLUSIONS WITH ONE WORD YOU ARREST THE FORMATION OF CAPITAL
6880-216547-0096.flac,AND WE BUILD HENCEFORTH UPON THE SAND INSTEAD OF ON A ROCK THAT I CANNOT AGREE TO AND FOR THAT REASON I HAVE CRITICISED YOUR BOOK SO FULL OF BEAUTIFUL PAGES
6880-216547-0097.flac,SO BRILLIANT WITH KNOWLEDGE AND FERVOR I WISH SIR THAT MY IMPAIRED HEALTH WOULD PERMIT ME TO EXAMINE WITH YOU PAGE BY PAGE THE MEMOIR WHICH YOU HAVE DONE ME THE HONOR TO ADDRESS TO ME PUBLICLY AND PERSONALLY
6880-216547-0098.flac,I DESIRE ALSO THE MERIT OF PRUDENCE YOU KNOW HOW DEEP SEATED IS THE DISEASE UNDER WHICH THE WORKING PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING I KNOW HOW MANY NOBLE HEARTS BEAT UNDER THOSE RUDE GARMENTS
6880-216547-0099.flac,WHO RISE EARLY IN THE MORNING TO LABOR TO PAY THEIR TAXES AND TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY STRONG I TRY TO SERVE AND ENLIGHTEN THEM WHEREAS SOME ENDEAVOR TO MISLEAD THEM
6880-216547-0100.flac,YOU HAVE NOT WRITTEN DIRECTLY FOR THEM YOU HAVE ISSUED TWO MAGNIFICENT MANIFESTOES THE SECOND MORE GUARDED THAN THE FIRST ISSUE A THIRD MORE GUARDED THAN THE SECOND
6880-216547-0101.flac,AND YOU WILL TAKE HIGH RANK IN SCIENCE WHOSE FIRST PRECEPT IS CALMNESS AND IMPARTIALITY FAREWELL SIR NO MAN'S ESTEEM FOR ANOTHER CAN EXCEED MINE FOR YOU BLANQUI
6880-216547-0102.flac,I SHOULD CERTAINLY TAKE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THIS NOBLE AND ELOQUENT LETTER BUT I CONFESS THAT I AM MORE INCLINED TO REALIZE THE PREDICTION WITH WHICH IT TERMINATES THAN TO AUGMENT NEEDLESSLY THE NUMBER OF MY ANTAGONISTS
6880-216547-0103.flac,SO MUCH CONTROVERSY FATIGUES AND WEARIES ME THE INTELLIGENCE EXPENDED IN THE WARFARE OF WORDS IS LIKE THAT EMPLOYED IN BATTLE IT IS INTELLIGENCE WASTED
6880-216547-0104.flac,I CALL PROPERTY
6880-216547-0105.flac,TO EACH OF US PROPERTY SEEMS A POLYGON WHOSE ANGLES NEED KNOCKING OFF BUT THE OPERATION PERFORMED
6880-216547-0106.flac,AN HYPOTHESIS ADMITTED IN MATHEMATICS ALTHOUGH NOT PROVEN WHILE I CONSIDER THAT THIS FIGURE WILL BE A CIRCLE HONEST PEOPLE CAN AT LEAST UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
6880-216547-0107.flac,FOR THE REST I ALLOW THAT IN THE PRESENT STATE OF THE QUESTION THE MIND MAY LEGITIMATELY HESITATE BEFORE DECIDING IN FAVOR OF THE ABOLITION OF PROPERTY
6880-216547-0108.flac,TO GAIN THE VICTORY FOR ONE'S CAUSE IT DOES NOT SUFFICE SIMPLY TO OVERTHROW A PRINCIPLE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHICH HAS THE INDISPUTABLE MERIT OF SYSTEMATICALLY RECAPITULATING OUR POLITICAL THEORIES
6880-216547-0109.flac,IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH THE OPPOSITE PRINCIPLE AND TO FORMULATE THE SYSTEM WHICH MUST PROCEED FROM IT STILL FURTHER IT IS NECESSARY TO SHOW THE METHOD BY WHICH THE NEW SYSTEM
6880-216547-0110.flac,WILL SATISFY ALL THE MORAL AND POLITICAL NEEDS WHICH INDUCED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIRST ON THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS THEN OF SUBSEQUENT EVIDENCE DEPENDS THE CORRECTNESS OF MY PRECEDING ARGUMENTS
6880-216547-0111.flac,THE DISCOVERY OF A SYSTEM OF ABSOLUTE EQUALITY IN WHICH ALL EXISTING INSTITUTIONS SAVE PROPERTY OR THE SUM OF THE ABUSES OF PROPERTY
6880-216547-0112.flac,NOT ONLY MAY FIND A PLACE BUT MAY THEMSELVES SERVE AS INSTRUMENTS OF EQUALITY INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY THE DIVISION OF POWER THE PUBLIC MINISTRY THE JURY SYSTEM
6880-216547-0113.flac,ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL ORGANIZATION THE UNITY AND COMPLETENESS OF INSTRUCTION MARRIAGE THE FAMILY HEREDITY IN DIRECT AND COLLATERAL SUCCESSION THE RIGHT OF SALE AND EXCHANGE THE RIGHT TO MAKE A WILL AND EVEN BIRTHRIGHT
6880-216547-0114.flac,A SYSTEM WHICH BETTER THAN PROPERTY GUARANTEES THE FORMATION OF CAPITAL AND KEEPS UP THE COURAGE OF ALL
6880-216547-0115.flac,THE ROAD THAT HE SHALL TRAVERSE WILL SUFFICE TO SHOW THE END
5778-54535-0000.flac,HE MEANT TO HAVE IT ONE OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD SO HE CALLED AN OFFICER INTO HIS COUNCIL CHAMBER AND SAID NOW TAKE PLENTY OF TIME TO LOOK ABOUT IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HAVE ALL THE MEN YOU WANT TO HELP YOU
5778-54535-0001.flac,BUT FIND ME SOMEWHERE AN ENGINEER THAT WILL LAY OUT A PERFECT RAILROAD LINE MEN APPOINTED BY THIS COLONEL TRAVELED SOME MONTHS THEY VISITED MANY CITIES WROTE LETTERS AND ASKED ADVICE THEN THE COLONEL WENT BACK TO THE EMPEROR AND SAID
5778-54535-0002.flac,THE MAN YOU NEED TO DO THIS PIECE OF WORK LIVES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WHAT'S HIS NAME ASKED NICOLAS HE IS MAJOR GEORGE WASHINGTON WHISTLER HE IS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE CITY IN WHICH HE LIVES LOWELL MASSACHUSETTS
5778-54535-0003.flac,HE IS A DISTINGUISHED ARMY OFFICER AND A FINE ENGINEER HE IS NAMED FOR A GREAT OFFICER ANSWERED NICOLAS REMEMBERING OUR GENERAL WASHINGTON AND HE DISPATCHED A LETTER TO THE LOWELL ENGINEER
5778-54535-0004.flac,THE MAJOR MADE HASTE TO START FOR RUSSIA BECAUSE THE HONOR WAS GREAT AND THE PAYMENT WOULD BE GENEROUS HE LEFT HIS BOYS AND HIS WIFE BEHIND BECAUSE HE DID NOT KNOW JUST HOW COMFORTABLE HE COULD MAKE THEM IN THE FAR OFF COUNTRY
5778-54535-0005.flac,BUT HE TOLD THE BOYS TO BE GOOD AND TO MIND THEIR MOTHER THESE BOYS WERE NAMED JAMES MC NEILL WILLIAM AND CHARLES THEIR MOTHER WAS A FINE WOMAN BUT SOMETIMES THEY WISHED SHE WOULD NOT BE QUITE SO STRICT
5778-54535-0006.flac,SHE USED TO SAY ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS COME BOYS EMPTY YOUR POCKETS AND GATHER UP YOUR TOYS WE WILL PUT THE KNIVES AND MARBLES AWAY AND GET READY FOR SUNDAY ALL DAY SUNDAY THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO READ ANY BOOK BUT THE BIBLE
5778-54535-0007.flac,BUT JAMES LIKED THE STORIES HE FOUND THERE AND WHEN HE WAS ONLY NINE COULD SAY ALMOST HALF THE BIBLE BY HEART JAMES WAS THE OLDEST IN THE FAMILY HE WAS BORN IN LOWELL AND WAS SUCH A CUNNING BABY THAT EVERYBODY WANTED HIS PICTURE
5778-54535-0008.flac,ONE OF HIS UNCLES WHO LOVED HIM DEARLY USED TO SAY IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS THIS WAS A GREAT ENGLISH PAINTER WHO HAD DIED YEARS BEFORE COME OUT OF HIS GRAVE TO PAINT JIMMIE ASLEEP
5778-54535-0009.flac,JIMMIE HAD DELICATE FEATURES AND LONG SILKY BROWN CURLS THAT HUNG ABOUT HIS FACE IN AMONG THESE WAS ONE WHITE LOCK THAT DROPPED STRAIGHT DOWN OVER HIS FOREHEAD THIS LOOKED LIKE A TINY FEATHER
5778-54535-0010.flac,MORE THAN ALL HIS PLAYTHINGS HE LIKED A PENCIL AND PAPER FROM THE TIME HE COULD SCRIBBLE AT ALL HE DREW PICTURES OF EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IN SIGHT
5778-54535-0011.flac,THESE PICTURES WERE VERY GOOD AND WHEN HE WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO GO TO SCHOOL THE OTHER CHILDREN WERE APT TO ASK HIM TO MAKE ANIMALS AND BIRDS FOR THEM ON THE BLACKBOARD MAJOR WHISTLER SOON SENT FOR HIS FAMILY TO JOIN HIM IN RUSSIA
5778-54535-0012.flac,IT WAS A LONG HARD VOYAGE THERE AND POOR LITTLE CHARLIE DIED ON THE WAY THE TWO OTHER BOYS WERE BETTER SAILORS AND WERE AS WELL AS COULD BE WHEN THEY MET THEIR FATHER THEY DID ENJOY THE STRANGE SIGHTS IN SAINT PETERSBURG
5778-54535-0013.flac,THEY WERE NOT LONG IN GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE LITTLE RUSSIAN CHILDREN OR IN LEARNING THE LANGUAGE THEY WENT SKATING DRESSED IN HANDSOME FURS THEY LEARNED THE FOLK AND FANCY DANCES JOINED IN THE WINTER SPORTS AND VOTED RUSSIA A FINE COUNTRY
5778-54535-0014.flac,STILL THEIR PARENTS DID NOT LET THEM FORGET THEY WERE LITTLE AMERICANS THE CLIMATE DID NOT AGREE WITH JAMES AND EVERY TIME HE CAUGHT COLD HE HAD TOUCHES OF RHEUMATISM SO THAT OFTEN HE HAD TO STAY IN THE HOUSE AND HAVE HIS FEET PUT IN HOT WATER
5778-54535-0015.flac,INSTEAD OF MAKING A FUSS ABOUT THIS HE USED TO CALL FOR PENCIL AND PAPER AND PRACTISE DRAWING FEET UNTIL HE COULD MAKE VERY PERFECT ONES MAJOR WHISTLER SENT HIM TO THE ART ACADEMY IN SAINT PETERSBURG WHERE HE WAS PRAISED BY HIS TEACHERS
5778-54535-0016.flac,THAT OLD TIRESOME RHEUMATISM KEPT BOTHERING HIM AND BY AND BY HE HAD A LONG RHEUMATIC FEVER
5778-54535-0017.flac,HE WAS A DEAR PATIENT BOY HOWEVER AND AFTERWARDS DECLARED HE WAS ALMOST GLAD HE HAD IT BECAUSE SOME ONE WHO PITIED THE SMALL INVALID SENT HIM A BOOK OF HOGARTH'S ENGRAVINGS
5778-54535-0018.flac,I WANT YOU TO BE SURE AND REMEMBER ABOUT THIS GENTLENESS AND PATIENCE BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS OLDER PEOPLE OFTEN ACCUSED HIM OF BEING CROSS AND RUDE BUT AT THIS TIME I AM SURE NO ONE COULD HAVE BEEN NICER
5778-54535-0019.flac,JAMES WAS VERY CAREFUL OF HIS MOTHER TOO ONE EVENING SHE HAD TAKEN THE BOYS IN A CARRIAGE TO SEE A BIG ILLUMINATION BANDS WERE PLAYING AND ROCKETS FLYING
5778-54535-0020.flac,THE HORSES NEXT THEIR CARRIAGE WERE FRIGHTENED AND REARED AND PLUNGED AS IF THEY WOULD HIT THE WHISTLER PARTY JAMES SHOVED HIS MOTHER DOWN ON THE SEAT BEHIND HIM AND STANDING IN FRONT OF HER BEAT THE HORSES BACK FROM THEM
5778-54535-0021.flac,HE ALWAYS WAS AS POLITE TO HER AS IF SHE WERE THE EMPEROR'S WIFE THE MAJOR WORKED TOO HARD ON THE GREAT RAILWAY AND DIED BEFORE JAMES WAS FIFTEEN
5778-54535-0022.flac,THE EMPEROR WAS FOND OF THE TWO BOYS AND WANTED THEM TO STAY ON IN RUSSIA AND BE TRAINED IN THE SCHOOL FOR PAGES OF THE COURT BUT THEIR MOTHER SAID THEY MUST GROW UP IN AMERICA AND HURRIED BACK TO HER OWN LAND
5778-54535-0023.flac,SHE DID NOT HAVE MUCH MONEY TO SPEND BUT THOUGHT JAMES SHOULD GO TO WEST POINT TO GET THE MILITARY TRAINING HIS FATHER HAD HAD AT THIS ACADEMY HE FOUND HE DID NOT LIKE TO DRAW MAPS AND FORTS NEARLY AS WELL AS HE DID HUMAN FIGURES AND FACES
5778-54535-0024.flac,ONCE WHEN HE HAD BEEN SENT TO WASHINGTON TO DRAW MAPS FOR THE COAST SURVEY HE FORGOT WHAT HE WAS ABOUT AND FILLED UP THE NICE WHITE MARGINS WITH PERT LITTLE DANCING FOLKS HE WAS WELL SCOLDED FOR THIS I CAN TELL YOU
5778-54535-0025.flac,JAMES WAS A TALL HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOW AT THIS TIME AND LIKED TO GO ABOUT TO DANCING PARTIES IN THE EVENING HE EARNED VERY LITTLE MAKING MAPS AND COULD NOT AFFORD TO BUY THE REAL NARROW TAILED COAT WHICH WAS PROPER
5778-54535-0026.flac,SO HE USED TO TAKE HIS FROCK COAT THAT HE WORE ALL DAY AND PIN IT BACK TO LOOK LIKE A DRESS COAT AND START OFF FOR BIG BALLS WHERE NOBODY WAS MUCH SHOCKED BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS DOING DROLL THINGS AND WAS SO LIVELY THAT HE WAS WELCOME IN ANY DRESS
5778-54535-0027.flac,AND THE MAP DRAWING HAD GROWN SO TIRESOME THAT JAMES HAD GIVEN UP WEST POINT AND SETTLED DOWN TO PAINTING AND ETCHING IN PARIS HE HAD DECIDED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WHICH SUITED HIM BUT THE LIFE OF AN ARTIST
5778-54535-0028.flac,HE WORKED QUITE STEADILY AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO SAY I THINK YOUNG WHISTLER IS GOING TO DO GREAT THINGS SOME DAY BUT SUDDENLY HE PACKED UP AND WENT TO LONDON
5778-54535-0029.flac,IN THIS CITY HE WAS PRAISED EVEN MORE BUT HE DID NOT SELL ENOUGH PICTURES TO PAY HIS BILLS AND ONCE WHEN HE HAD KEPT MEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR MONEY THAT HE OWED THEM OFFICERS CAME AND TOOK EVERYTHING AWAY BUT HIS PICTURES
5778-54535-0030.flac,THE ROOM LOOKED SO BARE AND HOMELY THAT WHISTLER PAINTED A VERY GOOD IMITATION OF FURNITURE ROUND THE WALLS OF HIS ROOM SO GOOD IN FACT THAT A RICH MAN WHO CAME TO LOOK AT THE PICTURES SAT DOWN IN ONE OF THE IMITATION CHAIRS AND FOUND HIMSELF ON THE FLOOR
5778-54535-0031.flac,IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT JAMES COULD GO A LONG TIME WITHOUT FOOD FOR IT TOOK NEARLY ALL HE COULD EARN FROM HIS PICTURES TO BUY PAINT AND CANVAS FOR OTHERS I DARE SAY THAT QUITE OFTEN WHEN IT WAS SAID
5778-54535-0032.flac,JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER IS GROWING RUDE AND CROSS THE REAL TRUTH OF THE MATTER WAS THAT JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER WAS HUNGRY AND WORRIED
5778-54535-0033.flac,HOWEVER HE BEGAN TO MAKE MONEY AT LAST AND JUST AS LIFE SEEMED BRIGHT AN ART CRITIC MISTER JOHN RUSKIN DECLARED THAT THE WHISTLER PICTURES WHICH WERE BEING BOUGHT AT BIG PRICES WERE POOR VERY POOR
5778-54535-0034.flac,MISTER RUSKIN SPOKE AND WHAT WAS WORSE PRINTED HIS OPINION I NEVER EXPECTED HE WROTE TO HEAR A COXCOMB ASK TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR FLINGING A POT OF PAINT IN THE PUBLIC'S FACE
5778-54535-0035.flac,WELL IT DID NOT LOOK FOR A WHILE AS IF THERE WAS ANY MORE GOOD LUCK IN THE WORLD FOR JAMES WHISTLER HE DID NOT LOSE ANY TIME IN GETTING A LAWYER TO SUE MISTER RUSKIN FOR SPOILING THE SALE OF HIS PICTURES
5778-54535-0036.flac,THERE WAS A TRIAL IN LONDON AND THE COURT ROOM WAS CROWDED SOME WERE THERE BECAUSE THEY ALREADY OWNED WHISTLER PICTURES AND WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THEY HAD PAID GOOD MONEY FOR BAD PICTURES OTHERS BECAUSE THEY WERE WARM FRIENDS OF THE ARTIST OR THE CRITIC
5778-54535-0037.flac,BUT EVEN MORE MEN AND WOMEN WENT TO HEAR THE SHARP QUESTIONS OF THE LAWYERS AND THE CLEVER ANSWERS OF RUSKIN AND WHISTLER WHISTLER WON THE CASE WHEN THE JUDGE AWARDED ONE FARTHING FOR DAMAGES THIS IS ONLY A QUARTER OF A CENT IN OUR MONEY
5778-54535-0038.flac,WHISTLER LAUGHED AND HUNG THE ENGLISH FARTHING ON HIS WATCH CHAIN FOR A CHARM MISTER RUSKIN HAD TO PAY THE COSTS OF THE TRIAL WHICH HAD MOUNTED UP TO NINETEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS SOME OF HIS FRIENDS INSISTED ON RAISING THAT SUM FOR HIM
5778-54535-0039.flac,ONE OF THEM SAID IT WAS WORTH NINETEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TO HAVE HEARD THE TALK THAT WENT ON IN THE COURT ROOM LATER MISTER WHISTLER RECEIVED MUCH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR A SINGLE PICTURE
5778-54535-0040.flac,TWO FAMOUS ONES OF WHICH WE OFTEN SEE PRINTS ARE PORTRAIT OF MY MOTHER AND THE SCOTCH WRITER CARLYLE JAMES WHISTLER'S MOTHER LIVED TO BE AN OLD WOMAN AS ONE CAN GUESS FROM THE PICTURE
5778-54535-0041.flac,AND HER SON LOVED HER JUST AS DEARLY AS HE DID WHEN HE BEAT THE PRANCING HORSES AWAY FROM HER IN RUSSIA THE FRENCH NATION BOUGHT THIS PORTRAIT AND IT HANGS IN THE LUXEMBOURG MUSEUM PARIS
5778-54535-0042.flac,THE SCOTCH PEOPLE WANTED TO OWN THE PORTRAIT OF CARLYLE AND THE CITY OF GLASGOW WAS GLAD TO PAY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR IT MISTER WHISTLER MARRIED A WOMAN WHO WAS HERSELF AN ARTIST AND SHE WAS VERY PROUD OF HIM
5778-54535-0043.flac,THE DUET ONE OF HIS PICTURES SHOWS HIS WIFE AND HER SISTER AT THE PIANO TWO PORTRAITS BY THIS AMERICAN ARTIST HANG IN THE BOSTON MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS BUT MOST OF THEM ARE OWNED IN ENGLAND
5778-54535-0044.flac,JAMES WHISTLER WAS ALWAYS KIND TO YOUNG ARTISTS AND LIKED TO HAVE THEM SIT BY HIM WHILE HE WORKED THEY WERE VERY PROUD TO BE NOTICED BY HIM FOR LONG BEFORE HE DIED HE HAD RECEIVED ALL KINDS OF HONORS AND MEDALS FROM FOREIGN ACADEMIES
5778-54535-0045.flac,AND FRANCE GERMANY AND ITALY MADE HIM AN OFFICER OF THE LEGION OF HONOR A COMMANDER AND A CHEVALIER
5778-54535-0046.flac,HE LOVED ART SO WELL THAT HE MADE WATER COLORS PASTELS ETCHINGS AND LITHOGRAPHS AS WELL AS OIL PAINTINGS HE DID NOT GET HIS FAME WITHOUT MUCH HARD WORK
5778-54535-0047.flac,YOU REMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES HE COPIED HIS OWN FOOT WHEN HE WAS A CHILD WELL HE WAS JUST AS PATIENT AND THOROUGH WHEN HE WAS OLDER FOR A LONG TIME HE MADE A PRACTICE OF DRAWING A PICTURE OF HIMSELF EVERY NIGHT BEFORE HE WENT TO BED
5778-54535-0048.flac,HE TRAVELED A GREAT DEAL PAINTING VIEWS IN MANY COUNTRIES AND STUDYING THE PICTURES OF OTHER ARTISTS BUT HOGARTH WAS HIS FAVORITE AND IT IS INTERESTING TO KNOW THAT JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER LIES BURIED VERY NEAR HOGARTH IN LONDON
5778-12761-0000.flac,CONTINUATION OF FREMONT'S ACCOUNT OF THE PASSAGE THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS WE HAD HARD AND DOUBTFUL LABOR YET BEFORE US AS THE SNOW APPEARED TO BE HEAVIER WHERE THE TIMBER BEGAN FURTHER DOWN WITH FEW OPEN SPOTS
5778-12761-0001.flac,ASCENDING A HEIGHT WE TRACED OUT THE BEST LINE WE COULD DISCOVER FOR THE NEXT DAY'S MARCH AND HAD AT LEAST THE CONSOLATION TO SEE THAT THE MOUNTAIN DESCENDED RAPIDLY THE DAY HAD BEEN ONE OF APRIL GUSTY WITH A FEW OCCASIONAL FLAKES OF SNOW
5778-12761-0002.flac,WHICH IN THE AFTERNOON ENVELOPED THE UPPER MOUNTAINS IN CLOUDS WE WATCHED THEM ANXIOUSLY AS NOW WE DREADED A SNOW STORM SHORTLY AFTERWARDS WE HEARD THE ROLL OF THUNDER AND LOOKING TOWARD THE VALLEY FOUND IT ALL ENVELOPED IN A THUNDERSTORM
5778-12761-0003.flac,FOR US AS CONNECTED WITH THE IDEA OF SUMMER IT HAD A SINGULAR CHARM AND WE WATCHED ITS PROGRESS WITH EXCITED FEELINGS UNTIL NEARLY SUNSET
5778-12761-0004.flac,WHEN THE SKY CLEARED OFF BRIGHTLY AND WE SAW A SHINING LINE OF WATER DIRECTING ITS COURSE TOWARDS ANOTHER A BROADER AND LARGER SHEET WE KNEW THAT THESE COULD BE NO OTHER THAN THE SACRAMENTO AND THE BAY OF SAN FRANCISCO
5778-12761-0005.flac,BUT AFTER OUR LONG WANDERING IN RUGGED MOUNTAINS WHERE SO FREQUENTLY WE HAD MET WITH DISAPPOINTMENTS AND WHERE THE CROSSING OF EVERY RIDGE DISPLAYED SOME UNKNOWN LAKE OR RIVER
5778-12761-0006.flac,WE WERE YET ALMOST AFRAID TO BELIEVE THAT WE WERE AT LAST TO ESCAPE INTO THE GENIAL COUNTRY OF WHICH WE HAVE HEARD SO MANY GLOWING DESCRIPTIONS AND DREADED AGAIN TO FIND SOME VAST INTERIOR LAKE WHOSE BITTER WATERS WOULD BRING US DISAPPOINTMENT
5778-12761-0007.flac,ON THE SOUTHERN SHORE OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE BAY COULD BE TRACED THE GLEAMING LINE WHERE ENTERED ANOTHER LARGE STREAM AND AGAIN THE BUENAVENTURA ROSE UP IN OUR MIND
5778-12761-0008.flac,CARSON HAD ENTERED THE VALLEY ALONG THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE BAY BUT THE COUNTRY THEN WAS SO ENTIRELY COVERED WITH WATER FROM SNOW AND RAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO FORM NO CORRECT IMPRESSION OF WATERCOURSES
5778-12761-0009.flac,WE HAD THE SATISFACTION TO KNOW THAT AT LEAST THERE WERE PEOPLE BELOW FIRES WERE LIT UP IN THE VALLEY JUST AT NIGHT APPEARING TO BE IN ANSWER TO OURS AND THESE SIGNS OF LIFE RENEWED IN SOME MEASURE THE GAYETY OF THE CAMP
5778-12761-0010.flac,THEY APPEARED SO NEAR THAT WE JUDGED THEM TO BE AMONG THE TIMBER OF SOME OF THE NEIGHBORING RIDGES BUT HAVING THEM CONSTANTLY IN VIEW DAY AFTER DAY AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT WE AFTERWARDS FOUND THEM TO BE FIRES THAT HAD BEEN KINDLED BY THE INDIANS AMONG THE TULARES
5778-12761-0011.flac,ON THE SHORE OF THE BAY EIGHTY MILES DISTANT AXES AND MAULS WERE NECESSARY TODAY TO MAKE A ROAD THROUGH THE SNOW GOING AHEAD WITH CARSON TO RECONNOITRE THE ROAD WE REACHED IN THE AFTERNOON THE RIVER WHICH MADE THE OUTLET OF THE LAKE
5778-12761-0012.flac,CARSON SPRANG OVER CLEAR ACROSS A PLACE WHERE THE STREAM WAS COMPRESSED AMONG ROCKS BUT THE PARFLECHE SOLE OF MY MOCCASIN GLANCED FROM THE ICY ROCK AND PRECIPITATED ME INTO THE RIVER
5778-12761-0013.flac,IT WAS SOME FEW SECONDS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER MYSELF IN THE CURRENT AND CARSON THINKING ME HURT JUMPED IN AFTER ME AND WE BOTH HAD AN ICY BATH WE TRIED TO SEARCH A WHILE FOR MY GUN WHICH HAD BEEN LOST IN THE FALL
5778-12761-0014.flac,BUT THE COLD DROVE US OUT AND MAKING A LARGE FIRE ON THE BANK AFTER WE HAD PARTIALLY DRIED OURSELVES WE WENT BACK TO MEET THE CAMP WE AFTERWARDS FOUND THAT THE GUN HAD BEEN SLUNG UNDER THE ICE WHICH LINED THE BANKS OF THE CREEK
5778-12761-0015.flac,THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND PURE WITH A SHARP WIND FROM THE NORTHEAST AND THE THERMOMETER TWENTY BELOW THE FREEZING POINT WE CONTINUED DOWN THE SOUTH FACE OF THE MOUNTAIN OUR ROAD LEADING OVER DRY GROUND WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID THE SNOW ALMOST ENTIRELY
5778-12761-0016.flac,IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING WE STRUCK A FOOT PATH WHICH WE WERE GENERALLY ABLE TO KEEP AND THE GROUND WAS SOFT TO OUR ANIMALS FEET BEING SANDY OR COVERED WITH MOULD GREEN GRASS BEGAN TO MAKE ITS APPEARANCE
5778-12761-0017.flac,AND OCCASIONALLY WE PASSED A HILL SCATTERINGLY COVERED WITH IT THE CHARACTER OF THE FOREST CONTINUED THE SAME AND AMONG THE TREES THE PINE WITH SHARP LEAVES AND VERY LARGE CONES WAS ABUNDANT SOME OF THEM BEING NOBLE TREES
5778-12761-0018.flac,WE MEASURED ONE THAT HAD TEN FEET DIAMETER THOUGH THE HEIGHT WAS NOT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FEET ALL ALONG THE RIVER WAS A ROARING TORRENT ITS FALL VERY GREAT AND DESCENDING WITH A RAPIDITY TO WHICH WE HAD LONG BEEN STRANGERS
5778-12761-0019.flac,TO OUR GREAT PLEASURE OAK TREES APPEARED ON THE RIDGE AND SOON BECAME VERY FREQUENT ON THESE I REMARKED UNUSUALLY GREAT QUANTITIES OF MISTLETOE THE OPPOSITE MOUNTAIN SIDE WAS VERY STEEP AND CONTINUOUS
5778-12761-0020.flac,UNBROKEN BY RAVINES AND COVERED WITH PINES AND SNOW WHILE ON THE SIDE WE WERE TRAVELLING INNUMERABLE RIVULETS POURED DOWN FROM THE RIDGE
5778-12761-0021.flac,CONTINUING ON WE HALTED A MOMENT AT ONE OF THESE RIVULETS TO ADMIRE SOME BEAUTIFUL EVERGREEN TREES RESEMBLING LIVE OAK WHICH SHADED THE LITTLE STREAM
5778-12761-0022.flac,THEY WERE FORTY TO FIFTY FEET HIGH AND TWO IN DIAMETER WITH A UNIFORM TUFTED TOP AND THE SUMMER GREEN OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL FOLIAGE WITH THE SINGING BIRDS AND THE SWEET SUMMER WIND WHICH WAS WHIRLING ABOUT THE DRY OAK LEAVES
5778-12761-0023.flac,NEARLY INTOXICATED US WITH DELIGHT AND WE HURRIED ON FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT TO ESCAPE ENTIRELY FROM THE HORRID REGION OF INHOSPITABLE SNOW TO THE PERPETUAL SPRING OF THE SACRAMENTO
5778-12761-0024.flac,I STARTED AHEAD THIS MORNING WITH A PARTY OF EIGHT CONSISTING WITH MYSELF
5778-12761-0025.flac,AND JACOB WE TOOK WITH US SOME OF THE BEST ANIMALS AND MY INTENTION WAS TO PROCEED AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE TO THE HOUSE OF MISTER SUTTER AND RETURN TO MEET THE PARTY WITH A SUPPLY OF PROVISIONS AND FRESH ANIMALS
5778-12761-0026.flac,NEAR NIGHT FALL WE DESCENDED INTO THE STEEP RAVINE OF A HANDSOME CREEK THIRTY FEET WIDE AND I WAS ENGAGED IN GETTING THE HORSES UP THE OPPOSITE HILL WHEN I HEARD A SHOUT FROM CARSON WHO HAD GONE AHEAD A FEW HUNDRED YARDS
5778-12761-0027.flac,LIFE YET SAID HE AS HE CAME UP LIFE YET I HAVE FOUND A HILLSIDE SPRINKLED WITH GRASS ENOUGH FOR THE NIGHT
5778-12761-0028.flac,WE DROVE ALONG OUR HORSES AND ENCAMPED AT THE PLACE ABOUT DARK AND THERE WAS JUST ROOM ENOUGH TO MAKE A PLACE FOR SHELTER ON THE EDGE OF THE STREAM THREE HORSES WERE LOST TODAY PROVEAU
5778-12761-0029.flac,A FINE YOUNG HORSE FROM THE COLUMBIA BELONGING TO CHARLES TOWNS AND ANOTHER INDIAN HORSE WHICH CARRIED OUR COOKING UTENSILS THE TWO FORMER GAVE OUT AND THE LATTER STRAYED OFF INTO THE WOODS AS WE REACHED THE CAMP
5778-12761-0030.flac,CARSON AND I CLIMBED ONE OF THE NEAREST MOUNTAINS THE FOREST LAND STILL EXTENDED AHEAD AND THE VALLEY APPEARED AS FAR AS EVER
5778-12761-0031.flac,WE BEGAN TO BE UNEASY AT DEROSIER'S ABSENCE FEARING HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEWILDERED IN THE WOODS CHARLES TOWNS WHO HAD NOT YET RECOVERED HIS MIND WENT TO SWIM IN THE RIVER AS IF IT WAS SUMMER AND THE STREAM PLACID
5778-12761-0032.flac,WHEN IT WAS A COLD MOUNTAIN TORRENT FOAMING AMONG THE ROCKS
5778-12761-0033.flac,HE CAME IN AND SITTING DOWN BY THE FIRE BEGAN TO TELL US WHERE HE HAD BEEN HE IMAGINED HE HAD BEEN GONE SEVERAL DAYS AND THOUGHT WE WERE STILL AT THE CAMP WHERE HE HAD LEFT US AND WE WERE PAINED TO SEE THAT HIS MIND WAS DERANGED
5778-12761-0034.flac,IT APPEARED THAT HE HAD BEEN LOST IN THE MOUNTAIN AND HUNGER AND FATIGUE JOINED TO WEAKNESS OF BODY AND FEAR OF PERISHING IN THE MOUNTAINS HAD CRAZED HIM THE TIMES WERE SEVERE WHEN STOUT MEN LOST THEIR MINDS FROM EXTREMITY OF SUFFERING
5778-12761-0035.flac,WHEN HORSES DIED AND WHEN MULES AND HORSES READY TO DIE OF STARVATION WERE KILLED FOR FOOD YET THERE WAS NO MURMURING OR HESITATION IN THE MEANTIME MISTER PREUSS CONTINUED ON DOWN THE RIVER
5778-12761-0036.flac,AND UNAWARE THAT WE HAD ENCAMPED SO EARLY IN THE DAY WAS LOST WHEN NIGHT ARRIVED AND HE DID NOT COME IN WE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO MAKE ANY SEARCH
5778-12761-0037.flac,WE FOLLOWED MISTER PREUSS'S TRAIL FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE ALONG THE RIVER UNTIL WE REACHED A PLACE WHERE HE HAD DESCENDED TO THE STREAM BELOW AND ENCAMPED HERE WE SHOUTED AND FIRED GUNS BUT RECEIVED NO ANSWER
5778-12761-0038.flac,AND WE CONCLUDED THAT HE HAD PUSHED ON DOWN THE STREAM I DETERMINED TO KEEP OUT FROM THE RIVER ALONG WHICH IT WAS NEARLY IMPRACTICABLE TO TRAVEL WITH ANIMALS UNTIL IT SHOULD FORM A VALLEY
5778-12761-0039.flac,AND OAKS BECAME THE PRINCIPAL TREES OF THE FOREST AMONG THESE THE PREVAILING TREE WAS THE EVERGREEN OAK WHICH BY WAY OF DISTINCTION WE SHALL CALL THE LIVE OAK
5778-12761-0040.flac,AND WITH THESE OCCURRED FREQUENTLY A NEW SPECIES OF OAK BEARING A LONG SLENDER ACORN FROM AN INCH TO AN INCH AND A HALF IN LENGTH WHICH WE NOW BEGAN TO SEE FORMED THE PRINCIPAL VEGETABLE FOOD OF THE INHABITANTS OF THIS REGION
5778-12761-0041.flac,IN A SHORT DISTANCE WE CROSSED A LITTLE RIVULET WHERE WERE TWO OLD HUTS AND NEAR BY WERE HEAPS OF ACORN HULLS THE GROUND ROUND ABOUT WAS VERY RICH COVERED WITH AN EXUBERANT SWARD OF GRASS
5778-12761-0042.flac,AND WE SAT DOWN FOR A WHILE IN THE SHADE OF THE OAKS TO LET THE ANIMALS FEED WE REPEATED OUR SHOUTS FOR MISTER PREUSS AND THIS TIME WE WERE GRATIFIED WITH AN ANSWER THE VOICE GREW RAPIDLY NEARER ASCENDING FROM THE RIVER
5778-12761-0043.flac,BUT WHEN WE EXPECTED TO SEE HIM EMERGE IT CEASED ENTIRELY WE HAD CALLED UP SOME STRAGGLING INDIAN THE FIRST WE HAD MET ALTHOUGH FOR TWO DAYS BACK WE HAD SEEN TRACKS
5778-12761-0044.flac,WHO MISTAKING US FOR HIS FELLOWS HAD BEEN ONLY UNDECEIVED BY GETTING CLOSE UP IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASANT TO WITNESS HIS ASTONISHMENT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE FRIGHTENED HAD SOME OF THE OLD MOUNTAIN SPIRITS THEY ARE SO MUCH AFRAID OF
5778-12761-0045.flac,SUDDENLY APPEARED IN HIS PATH IGNORANT OF THE CHARACTER OF THESE PEOPLE WE HAD NOW ADDITIONAL CAUSE OF UNEASINESS IN REGARD TO MISTER PREUSS HE HAD NO ARMS WITH HIM AND WE BEGAN TO THINK HIS CHANCE DOUBTFUL
5778-12761-0046.flac,AT ONE OF THESE ORCHARD GROUNDS WE ENCAMPED ABOUT NOON TO MAKE AN EFFORT FOR MISTER PREUSS ONE MAN TOOK HIS WAY ALONG A SPUR LEADING INTO THE RIVER IN HOPE TO CROSS HIS TRAIL AND ANOTHER TOOK OUR OWN BACK
5778-12761-0047.flac,BOTH WERE VOLUNTEERS AND TO THE SUCCESSFUL MAN WAS PROMISED A PAIR OF PISTOLS NOT AS A REWARD BUT AS A TOKEN OF GRATITUDE FOR A SERVICE WHICH WOULD FREE US ALL FROM MUCH ANXIETY
5778-12761-0048.flac,AT THE END OF FOUR DAYS MISTER PREUSS SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED HIS FRIENDS BY WALKING INTO CAMP HE HAD LIVED ON ROOTS AND ACORNS AND WAS IN THE LAST STAGES OF EXHAUSTION
5778-12761-0049.flac,SHORTLY THE ADVANCE PARTY REACHED SUTTER'S FORT WHERE THEY RECEIVED THE MOST HOSPITABLE TREATMENT
7264-92314-0000.flac,I SAY THAT THE FEW NEWSPAPER CONTROLLERS GOVERN AND GOVERN ABOMINABLY I AM RIGHT BUT THEY ONLY DO SO AS DO ALL NEW POWERS BY AT ONCE ALLIANCE WITH AND TREASON AGAINST THE OLD WITNESS HARMSWORTH AND THE POLITICIANS
7264-92314-0001.flac,THIS CONNECTION HAS DEVELOPED IN THE GREAT CAPITALIST PAPERS A CERTAIN CHARACTER WHICH CAN BE BEST DESCRIBED BY THE TERM OFFICIAL UNDER CERTAIN FORMS OF ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE MINISTERS ONCE MADE USE OF PICKED
7264-92314-0002.flac,AND RARE NEWSPAPERS TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS AND THESE NEWSPAPERS CAME TO BE CALLED THE OFFICIAL PRESS IT WAS A CRUDE METHOD AND HAS BEEN LONG ABANDONED EVEN BY THE SIMPLER DESPOTIC FORMS OF GOVERNMENT NOTHING OF THAT KIND EXISTS NOW OF COURSE IN THE DEEPER CORRUPTION OF MODERN EUROPE
7264-92314-0003.flac,LEAST OF ALL IN ENGLAND WHAT HAS GROWN UP HERE IS A PRESS ORGANIZATION OF SUPPORT AND FAVOUR TO THE SYSTEM OF PROFESSIONAL POLITICS WHICH COLOURS THE WHOLE OF OUR GREAT CAPITALIST PAPERS TO DAY IN ENGLAND THIS GIVES THEM SO DISTINCT A CHARACTER OF PARLIAMENTARY FALSEHOOD
7264-92314-0004.flac,AND THAT FALSEHOOD IS SO CLEARLY DICTATED BY THEIR CONNECTION WITH EXECUTIVE POWER THAT THEY MERIT THE TITLE OFFICIAL THE REGIME UNDER WHICH WE ARE NOW LIVING IS THAT OF A PLUTOCRACY WHICH HAS GRADUALLY REPLACED THE OLD ARISTOCRATIC TRADITION OF ENGLAND
7264-92314-0005.flac,THIS PLUTOCRACY A FEW WEALTHY INTERESTS IN PART CONTROLS IN PART IS EXPRESSED BY IS IN PART IDENTICAL WITH THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS AND IT HAS IN THE EXISTING CAPITALIST PRESS AN ALLY SIMILAR TO THAT OFFICIAL PRESS
7264-92314-0006.flac,WHICH CONTINENTAL NATIONS KNEW IN THE PAST BUT THERE IS THIS GREAT DIFFERENCE THAT THE OFFICIAL PRESS OF CONTINENTAL EXPERIMENTS NEVER CONSISTED IN MORE THAN A FEW CHOSEN ORGANS
7264-92314-0007.flac,THE CHARACTER OF WHICH WAS WELL KNOWN AND THE ATTITUDE OF WHICH CONTRASTED SHARPLY WITH THE REST BUT OUR OFFICIAL PRESS FOR IT IS NO LESS COVERS THE WHOLE FIELD IT HAS IN THE REGION OF THE GREAT NEWSPAPERS NO COMPETITOR INDEED IT HAS NO COMPETITORS AT ALL
7264-92314-0008.flac,IF ANY ONE DOUBTS THAT THIS ADJECTIVE OFFICIAL CAN PROPERLY BE APPLIED TO OUR CAPITALIST PRESS TO DAY LET HIM ASK HIMSELF FIRST WHAT THE FORCES ARE WHICH GOVERN THE NATION AND NEXT WHETHER THOSE FORCES THAT GOVERNMENT OR REGIME
7264-92314-0009.flac,COULD BE BETTER SERVED EVEN UNDER A SYSTEM OF PERMANENT CENSORSHIP THAN IT IS IN THE GREAT DAILIES OF LONDON AND THE PRINCIPAL PROVINCIAL CAPITALS IS NOT EVERYTHING WHICH THE REGIME DESIRES TO BE SUPPRESSED SUPPRESSED IS NOT EVERYTHING WHICH IT DESIRES SUGGESTED SUGGESTED
7264-92314-0010.flac,AND IS THERE ANY PUBLIC QUESTION WHICH WOULD WEAKEN THE REGIME AND THE DISCUSSION OF WHICH IS EVER ALLOWED TO APPEAR IN THE GREAT CAPITALIST JOURNALS THERE HAS NOT BEEN SUCH A CASE FOR AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS
7264-92314-0011.flac,NEVER DEALS WITH MATTERS VITAL TO ITS PRESTIGE ON THE CONTRARY IT DELIBERATELY SIDE TRACKS ANY VITAL DISCUSSION THAT SINCERE CONVICTION MAY HAVE FORCED UPON THE PUBLIC AND SPOILS THE SCENT WITH FALSE ISSUES
7264-92314-0012.flac,ONE PAPER NOT A LITTLE WHILE AGO WAS CLAMOURING AGAINST THE EXCESS OF LAWYERS IN GOVERNMENT ITS REMEDY WAS AN OPPOSITION TO BE HEADED BY A LAWYER ANOTHER WAS VERY SERIOUS UPON SECRET TRADING WITH THE ENEMY
7264-92314-0013.flac,IT SUPPRESSED FOR MONTHS ALL REFERENCE TO THE ASTOUNDING INSTANCE OF THAT MISDEMEANOUR BY THE CONNECTIONS OF A VERY PROMINENT PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN EARLY IN THE WAR AND REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THE SINGLE REFERENCE MADE TO THIS CRIME IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
7264-92314-0014.flac,ANOTHER CLAMOURS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF ENEMY FINANCIAL POWER IN THE AFFAIRS OF THIS COUNTRY AND YET SAYS NOT A WORD UPON THE AUDITING OF THE SECRET PARTY FUNDS
7264-92314-0015.flac,I SAY THAT THE BIG DAILY PAPERS HAVE NOW NOT ONLY THOSE OTHER QUALITIES DANGEROUS TO THE STATE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED BUT THAT THEY HAVE BECOME ESSENTIALLY OFFICIAL THAT IS INSINCERE AND CORRUPT IN THEIR INTERESTED SUPPORT OF THAT PLUTOCRATIC COMPLEX WHICH IN THE DECAY OF ARISTOCRACY GOVERNS ENGLAND
7264-92314-0016.flac,THEY ARE NOT INDEPENDENT WHERE POWER IS CONCERNED THEY DO NOT REALLY CRITICIZE THEY SERVE A CLIQUE WHOM THEY SHOULD EXPOSE AND DENOUNCE AND BETRAY THE GENERALITY THAT IS THE STATE FOR WHOSE SAKE THE SALARIED PUBLIC SERVANTS SHOULD BE PERPETUALLY WATCHED WITH SUSPICION AND SHARPLY KEPT IN CONTROL
7264-92314-0017.flac,THE RESULT IS THAT THE MASS OF ENGLISHMEN HAVE CEASED TO OBTAIN OR EVEN TO EXPECT INFORMATION UPON THE WAY THEY ARE GOVERNED THEY ARE BEGINNING TO FEEL A CERTAIN UNEASINESS THEY KNOW THAT THEIR OLD POWER OF OBSERVATION OVER PUBLIC SERVANTS HAS SLIPPED FROM THEM
7264-92314-0018.flac,THEY SUSPECT THAT THE KNOWN GROSS CORRUPTION OF PUBLIC LIFE AND PARTICULARLY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IS ENTRENCHED BEHIND A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE ON THE PART OF THOSE VERY FEW WHO HAVE THE POWER TO INFORM THEM BUT AS YET THEY HAVE NOT PASSED THE STAGE OF SUCH SUSPICION
7264-92314-0019.flac,THEY HAVE NOT ADVANCED NEARLY AS FAR AS THE DISCOVERY OF THE GREAT NEWSPAPER OWNERS AND THEIR SYSTEM THEY ARE STILL FOR THE MOST PART DUPED
7264-92314-0020.flac,IS A VERY GREAT EVIL IT WARPS AND DEPLETES PUBLIC INFORMATION IT PREVENTS THE JUST CRITICISM OF PUBLIC SERVANTS ABOVE ALL IT GIVES IMMENSE AND IRRESPONSIBLE POWER TO A HANDFUL OF WEALTHY MEN
7264-92314-0021.flac,AND ESPECIALLY TO THE ONE MOST WEALTHY AND UNSCRUPULOUS AMONG THEM WHOSE WEALTH IS AN ACCIDENT OF SPECULATION WHOSE ORIGINS ARE REPULSIVE AND WHOSE CHARACTERS HAVE AS A RULE THE WEAKNESS AND BASENESS DEVELOPED BY THIS SORT OF ADVENTURES
7264-92314-0022.flac,THERE ARE AMONG SUCH GUTTER SNIPES THOUSANDS WHOSE LUCK ENDS IN THE NATIVE GUTTER HALF A DOZEN WHOSE LUCK LANDS THEM INTO MILLIONS ONE OR TWO AT MOST WHO ON THE TOP OF SUCH A CAREER GO CRAZY WITH THE AMBITION OF THE PARVENU AND PROPOSE TO DIRECT THE STATE
7264-92314-0023.flac,EVEN WHEN GAMBLING ADVENTURERS OF THIS SORT ARE KNOWN AND RESPONSIBLE AS THEY ARE IN PROFESSIONAL POLITICS THEIR POWER IS A GRAVE DANGER POSSESSING AS THE NEWSPAPER OWNERS DO EVERY POWER OF CONCEALMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME
7264-92314-0024.flac,NO SHRED OF RESPONSIBILITY TO ANY ORGAN OF THE STATE THEY ARE A DEADLY PERIL THE CHIEF OF THESE MEN ARE MORE POWERFUL TO DAY THAN ANY MINISTER NAY THEY DO AS I HAVE SAID AND IT IS NOW NOTORIOUS MAKE AND UNMAKE MINISTERS AND THEY MAY YET IN OUR WORST HOUR DECIDE THE NATIONAL FATE
7264-92314-0025.flac,NOW TO EVERY HUMAN EVIL OF A POLITICAL SORT THAT HAS APPEARED IN HISTORY TO EVERY EVIL THAT IS AFFECTING THE STATE AND PROCEEDING FROM THE WILL OF MAN NOT FROM UNGOVERNABLE NATURAL FORCES OUTSIDE MAN THERE COMES A TERM AND A REACTION
7264-92314-0026.flac,SIDE BY SIDE WITH WHAT I HAVE CALLED THE OFFICIAL PRESS IN OUR TOP HEAVY PLUTOCRACY THERE HAS ARISEN A CERTAIN FORCE FOR WHICH I HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN FINDING A NAME BUT WHICH I WILL CALL FOR LACK OF A BETTER NAME THE FREE PRESS I MIGHT CALL IT THE INDEPENDENT PRESS
7264-92314-0027.flac,WERE IT NOT THAT SUCH A WORD WOULD CONNOTE AS YET A LITTLE TOO MUCH POWER THOUGH I DO BELIEVE ITS POWER TO BE RISING AND THOUGH I AM CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL IN THE NEAR FUTURE CHANGE OUR AFFAIRS
7264-92314-0028.flac,I AM NOT ACQUAINTED WITH ANY OTHER MODERN LANGUAGE THAN FRENCH AND ENGLISH BUT I READ THIS FREE PRESS FRENCH AND ENGLISH COLONIAL AND AMERICAN REGULARLY AND IT SEEMS TO ME THE CHIEF INTELLECTUAL PHENOMENON OF OUR TIME
7264-92314-0029.flac,IN FRANCE AND IN ENGLAND AND FOR ALL I KNOW ELSEWHERE THERE HAS ARISEN IN PROTEST AGAINST THE COMPLETE CORRUPTION AND FALSEHOOD OF THE GREAT CAPITALIST PAPERS A CROP OF NEW ORGANS WHICH ARE IN THE STRICTEST SENSE OF THE WORD ORGANS OF OPINION
7264-92314-0030.flac,THE NEW AGE WAS I THINK THE PIONEER IN THE MATTER
7264-92314-0031.flac,SCOTLAND ONE OR TWO THEIR NUMBER WILL INCREASE WITH THIS I PASS FROM THE JUST DENUNCIATION OF EVIL TO THE EXPOSITION OF WHAT IS GOOD
7264-92310-0000.flac,LET US HALT AT THIS PHASE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE THING TO CONSIDER CERTAIN OTHER CHANGES WHICH WERE ON THE POINT OF APPEARANCE AND WHY THEY WERE ON THE POINT OF APPEARANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE IF ADVERTISEMENT HAD COME TO BE THE STAND BY OF A NEWSPAPER
7264-92310-0001.flac,THE CAPITALIST OWNING THE SHEET WOULD NECESSARILY CONSIDER HIS REVENUE FROM ADVERTISEMENT BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE HE WAS INDEED COMPELLED TO DO SO UNLESS HE HAD ENORMOUS REVENUES FROM OTHER SOURCES AND RAN HIS PAPER AS A LUXURY COSTING A VAST FORTUNE A YEAR
7264-92310-0002.flac,FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY THE RULE IS EITHER VERY GREAT PROFITS OR VERY GREAT AND RAPID LOSSES
7264-92310-0003.flac,WHERE A GREAT DAILY PAPER IS CONCERNED HE WAS COMPELLED THEN TO RESPECT HIS ADVERTISERS AS HIS PAYMASTERS TO THAT EXTENT THEREFORE HIS POWER OF GIVING TRUE NEWS AND OF PRINTING SOUND OPINION WAS LIMITED EVEN THOUGH HIS OWN INCLINATIONS SHOULD LEAN TOWARDS SUCH NEWS AND SUCH OPINION
7264-92310-0004.flac,AN INDIVIDUAL NEWSPAPER OWNER MIGHT FOR INSTANCE HAVE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE DISLIKE FOR THE TRADE IN PATENT MEDICINES HE MIGHT OBJECT TO THE SWINDLING OF THE POOR WHICH IS THE SOUL OF THAT TRADE HE MIGHT HIMSELF HAVE SUFFERED ACUTE PHYSICAL PAIN
7264-92310-0005.flac,BUT HE CERTAINLY COULD NOT PRINT AN ARTICLE AGAINST THEM NOR EVEN AN ARTICLE DESCRIBING HOW THEY WERE MADE WITHOUT LOSING A GREAT PART OF HIS INCOME DIRECTLY AND PERHAPS INDIRECTLY THE WHOLE OF IT FROM THE ANNOYANCE CAUSED TO OTHER ADVERTISERS WHO WOULD NOTE HIS INDEPENDENCE
7264-92310-0006.flac,AND FEAR FRICTION IN THEIR OWN CASE HE WOULD PREFER TO RETAIN HIS INCOME PERSUADE HIS READERS TO BUY POISON AND REMAIN FREE PERSONALLY FROM TOUCHING THE STUFF HE RECOMMENDED FOR PAY
7264-92310-0007.flac,THE PROPRIETOR WAS ALWAYS AT THE CHOICE OF PUBLISHING MATTER WHICH DID NOT AFFECT HIM AND SAVING HIS FORTUNE OR REFUSING IT AND JEOPARDIZING HIS FORTUNE HE CHOSE THE FORMER COURSE IN THE SECOND PLACE THERE WAS AN EVEN MORE SERIOUS DEVELOPMENT ADVERTISEMENT
7264-92310-0008.flac,HAVING BECOME THE STAND BY OF THE NEWSPAPER THE LARGE ADVERTISER
7264-92310-0009.flac,COULD NOT BUT REGARD HIS GIVING OF AN ADVERTISEMENT AS SOMETHING OF A FAVOUR THERE IS ALWAYS THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL OR IF YOU WILL ARTISTIC ELEMENT IN EXCHANGE IN PURE ECONOMICS EXCHANGE IS EXACTLY BALANCED BY THE RESPECTIVE ADVANTAGES OF THE EXCHANGERS
7264-92310-0010.flac,JUST AS IN PURE DYNAMICS YOU HAVE THE PARALLELOGRAM OF FORCES IN THE IMMENSE COMPLEXITY OF THE REAL WORLD MATERIAL FRICTION AND A MILLION OTHER THINGS AFFECT THE IDEAL PARALLELOGRAM OF FORCES AND IN ECONOMICS OTHER CONSCIOUS PASSIONS
7264-92310-0011.flac,BESIDES THOSE OF MERE AVARICE AFFECT EXCHANGE THERE ARE A MILLION HALF CONSCIOUS AND SUB CONSCIOUS MOTIVES AT WORK AS WELL THE LARGE ADVERTISER STILL MAINLY PAID FOR ADVERTISEMENT ACCORDING TO CIRCULATION
7264-92310-0012.flac,HE WOULD NOT ADVERTISE IN PAPERS WHICH HE THOUGHT MIGHT BY THEIR PUBLICATION OF OPINION ULTIMATELY HURT CAPITALISM AS A WHOLE STILL LESS IN THOSE WHOSE OPINIONS MIGHT AFFECT HIS OWN PRIVATE FORTUNE ADVERSELY STUPID LIKE ALL PEOPLE GIVEN UP TO GAIN
7264-92310-0013.flac,HE WAS MUDDLE HEADED ABOUT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A LARGE CIRCULATION AND A CIRCULATION SMALL BUT APPEALING TO THE RICH HE WOULD REFUSE ADVERTISEMENTS OF LUXURIES TO A PAPER READ BY HALF THE WEALTHIER CLASS IF HE HAD HEARD IN THE NATIONAL LIBERAL CLUB
7264-92310-0014.flac,OR SOME SUCH PLACE THAT THE PAPER WAS IN BAD TASTE NOT ONLY WAS THERE THIS NEGATIVE POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE ADVERTISER THAT OF REFUSING THE FAVOUR OR PATRONAGE OF HIS ADVERTISEMENTS THERE WAS ALSO A POSITIVE ONE THOUGH THAT ONLY GREW UP LATER
7264-92310-0015.flac,THE ADVERTISER CAME TO SEE THAT HE COULD ACTUALLY DICTATE POLICY AND OPINION AND THAT HE HAD ALSO ANOTHER MOST POWERFUL AND NOVEL WEAPON IN HIS HAND WHICH WAS THE SUPPRESSION OF NEWS
7264-92310-0016.flac,WE MUST NOT EXAGGERATE THIS ELEMENT FOR ONE THING THE POWER REPRESENTED BY THE GREAT CAPITALIST PRESS WAS A POWER EQUAL WITH THAT OF THE GREAT ADVERTISERS FOR ANOTHER THERE WAS NO CLEAR CUT DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CAPITALISM THAT OWNED NEWSPAPERS AND THE CAPITALISM THAT ADVERTISED
7264-92310-0017.flac,THE SAME MAN WHO OWNED THE DAILY TIMES WAS A SHAREHOLDER IN JONES'S SOAP OR SMITH'S PILLS THE MAN WHO GAMBLED AND LOST ON THE HOWL WAS AT THE SAME TIME GAMBLING AND WINNING ON A BUCKET SHOP ADVERTISED IN THE HOWL
7264-92310-0018.flac,THERE WAS NO ANTAGONISM OF CLASS INTEREST ONE AGAINST THE OTHER AND WHAT WAS MORE THEY WERE OF THE SAME KIND AND BREED
7264-92310-0019.flac,WAS EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF MAN AS HE WHO BOUGHT A PEERAGE OUT OF A COMBINE IN MUSIC HALLS OR CUT HIS THROAT WHEN HIS BLUFF IN INDIAN SILVER WAS CALLED THE TYPE IS THE COMMON MODERN TYPE PARLIAMENT IS FULL OF IT AND IT RUNS NEWSPAPERS ONLY AS ONE OF ITS ACTIVITIES
7264-92310-0020.flac,ALL OF WHICH NEED THE SUGGESTION OF ADVERTISEMENT THE NEWSPAPER OWNER AND THE ADVERTISER THEN WERE INTERMIXED BUT ON THE BALANCE THE ADVERTISING INTEREST BEING WIDER SPREAD WAS THE STRONGER AND WHAT YOU GOT WAS A SORT OF IMPOSITION
7264-92310-0021.flac,OFTEN QUITE CONSCIOUS AND DIRECT OF ADVERTISING POWER OVER THE PRESS AND THIS WAS AS I HAVE SAID NOT ONLY NEGATIVE THAT WAS LONG OBVIOUS BUT AT LAST POSITIVE
7264-92310-0022.flac,BOTH COMBATANTS ARE OF A LOW CUNNING AND UNINTELLIGENT TYPE MINOR FRICTION DUE TO THE SAME CAUSE IS CONSTANTLY TAKING PLACE SOMETIMES THE VICTORY FALLS TO THE NEWSPAPER PROPRIETOR MORE OFTEN TO THE ADVERTISER NEVER TO THE PUBLIC
7264-92310-0023.flac,SO FAR WE SEE THE GROWTH OF THE PRESS MARKED BY THESE CHARACTERISTICS ONE IT FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF A VERY FEW RICH MEN AND NEARLY ALWAYS OF MEN OF BASE ORIGIN AND CAPACITIES TWO IT IS IN THEIR HANDS A MERE COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE
7264-92310-0024.flac,THREE IT IS ECONOMICALLY SUPPORTED BY ADVERTISERS WHO CAN IN PART CONTROL IT BUT THESE ARE OF THE SAME CAPITALIST KIND IN MOTIVE AND MANNER WITH THE OWNERS OF THE PAPERS THEIR POWER DOES NOT THEREFORE CLASH IN THE MAIN WITH THAT OF THE OWNERS
7264-92310-0025.flac,BUT THE FACT THAT ADVERTISEMENT MAKES A PAPER HAS CREATED A STANDARD OF PRINTING AND PAPER SUCH THAT NO ONE SAVE AT A DISASTROUS LOSS CAN ISSUE REGULARLY TO LARGE NUMBERS NEWS AND OPINION WHICH THE LARGE CAPITALIST ADVERTISERS DISAPPROVE
7264-92310-0026.flac,THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE FOR ANY INDEPENDENT PRESS NO POSSIBLE ECONOMIC BASIS BECAUSE THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN TAUGHT TO EXPECT FOR
7264-92310-0027.flac,THE DIFFERENCE BEING PAID BY THE ADVERTISEMENT SUBSIDY
7264-92310-0028.flac,IT IS THE ADVENT OF THE GREAT NEWSPAPER OWNER AS THE TRUE GOVERNING POWER IN THE POLITICAL MACHINERY OF THE STATE SUPERIOR TO THE OFFICIALS IN THE STATE NOMINATING MINISTERS AND DISMISSING THEM IMPOSING POLICIES AND IN GENERAL USURPING SOVEREIGNTY
7264-92310-0029.flac,ALL THIS SECRETLY AND WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY IT IS THE CHIEF POLITICAL EVENT OF OUR TIME AND IS THE PECULIAR MARK OF THIS COUNTRY TO DAY ITS FULL DEVELOPMENT HAS COME ON US SUDDENLY AND TAKEN US BY SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF A TERRIBLE WAR
7264-92310-0030.flac,IT WAS UNDREAMT OF BUT A FEW YEARS AGO IT IS ALREADY TO DAY THE CAPITAL FACT OF OUR WHOLE POLITICAL SYSTEM A PRIME MINISTER IS MADE OR DEPOSED BY THE OWNER OF A GROUP OF NEWSPAPERS NOT BY POPULAR VOTE OR BY ANY OTHER FORM OF OPEN AUTHORITY
7264-92310-0031.flac,NO POLICY IS ATTEMPTED UNTIL IT IS ASCERTAINED THAT THE NEWSPAPER OWNER IS IN FAVOUR OF IT FEW ARE PROFFERED WITHOUT FIRST CONSULTING HIS WISHES MANY ARE DIRECTLY ORDERED BY HIM WE ARE IF WE TALK IN TERMS OF REAL THINGS AS MEN DO IN THEIR PRIVATE COUNCILS AT WESTMINSTER
7264-92310-0032.flac,MAINLY GOVERNED TO DAY NOT EVEN BY THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS NOR EVEN BY THOSE WHO PAY THEM MONEY BUT BY WHATEVER OWNER OF A NEWSPAPER TRUST IS FOR THE MOMENT THE MOST UNSCRUPULOUS AND THE MOST AMBITIOUS
7264-92316-0000.flac,THE MOTIVE OF PROPAGANDA WHICH BEGAN TO WORK MUCH THE EARLIEST OF THE THREE CONCERNED RELIGIONS AND ALSO CERTAIN RACIAL ENTHUSIASMS OR POLITICAL DOCTRINES WHICH BY THEIR SINCERITY AND READINESS FOR SACRIFICE HAD HALF THE FORCE OF RELIGIONS
7264-92316-0001.flac,MEN FOUND THAT THE GREAT PAPERS IN THEIR FINAL PHASE REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT IN RELIGION THEY DARED DO NOTHING BUT REPEAT VERY DISCREETLY THE VAGUEST ETHICAL PLATITUDES THEY HARDLY DARED DO EVEN THAT THEY TOOK FOR GRANTED A SORT OF INVERTEBRATE COMMON OPINION
7264-92316-0002.flac,AND THERE WAS AN END OF IT GREAT BODIES OF MEN WHO CARED INTENSELY FOR A DEFINITE CREED FOUND THAT EXPRESSION FOR IT WAS LACKING
7264-92316-0003.flac,THE ORGANS OF OPINION PROFESSED A GENTEEL IGNORANCE OF THAT IDEA WHICH WAS MOST WIDESPREAD MOST INTENSE AND MOST FORMATIVE
7264-92316-0004.flac,THERE WAS NOTHING TO DISTINGUISH A LARGE DAILY PAPER OWNED BY A JEW FROM ONE OWNED BY AN AGNOSTIC OR A CATHOLIC NECESSITY OF EXPRESSION COMPELLED THE CREATION OF A FREE PRESS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS ONE MOTIVE OF RELIGION MEN CAME ACROSS VERY LITTLE OF THIS IN ENGLAND
7264-92316-0005.flac,BECAUSE ENGLAND WAS FOR LONG VIRTUALLY HOMOGENEOUS IN RELIGION AND THAT RELIGION WAS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC DURING THE YEARS IN WHICH THE FREE PRESS AROSE BUT SUCH A FREE PRESS IN DEFENCE OF RELIGION THE PIONEER OF ALL THE FREE PRESS AROSE IN IRELAND AND IN FRANCE AND ELSEWHERE
7264-92316-0006.flac,BUT IT ASSERTED THE NECESSITY OF SPECIALLY EMPHASIZING ITS PARTICULAR POINT OF VIEW IN ITS OWN COLUMNS FOR RELIGION AFFECTS ALL LIFE
7264-92316-0007.flac,A GENERATION AGO AND MORE GREAT NUMBERS OF MEN WERE PERSUADED THAT A SOLUTION FOR THE WHOLE COMPLEX OF SOCIAL INJUSTICE WAS TO BE FOUND IN WHAT THEY CALLED NATIONALIZING THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE
7264-92316-0008.flac,THAT IS OF COURSE IN PLAIN ENGLISH PUTTING LAND HOUSES AND MACHINERY AND STORES OF FOOD AND CLOTHING INTO THE HANDS OF THE POLITICIANS FOR CONTROL IN USE AND FOR DISTRIBUTION IN CONSUMPTION
7264-92316-0009.flac,THIS CREED WAS HELD WITH PASSIONATE CONVICTION BY MEN OF THE HIGHEST ABILITY IN EVERY COUNTRY OF EUROPE AND A SOCIALIST PRESS BEGAN TO ARISE WHICH WAS EVERYWHERE FREE AND SOON IN ACTIVE OPPOSITION TO THE OFFICIAL PRESS
7264-92316-0010.flac,AGAIN OF A RELIGIOUS TEMPER IN THEIR SEGREGATION CONVICTION AND ENTHUSIASM THERE BEGAN TO APPEAR WHEN THE OPPRESSOR WAS MILD THE SMALL PAPERS DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF OPPRESSED NATIONALITIES
7264-92316-0011.flac,RELIGION THEN AND COGNATE ENTHUSIASMS WERE THE FIRST BREEDERS OF THE FREE PRESS IT IS EXCEEDINGLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THIS BECAUSE IT HAS STAMPED THE WHOLE MOVEMENT WITH A PARTICULAR CHARACTER TO WHICH I SHALL LATER REFER WHEN I COME TO ITS DISABILITIES
7264-92316-0012.flac,FELT NO PARTICULAR ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE DEBATS FOR INSTANCE HIS PARTICULAR CATHOLIC ENTHUSIASM RECOGNIZED ITSELF AS EXCEPTIONAL AND WAS CONTENT TO ACCEPT THE HUMBLE OR AT ANY RATE INFERIOR POSITION WHICH ADMITTED ECCENTRICITY CONNOTES LATER
7264-92316-0013.flac,THESE FOUNDERS OF THE FREE PRESS SEEMED TO SAY WE MAY CONVERT THE MASS TO OUR VIEWS BUT FOR THE MOMENT WE ARE ADMITTEDLY A CLIQUE AN EXCEPTIONAL BODY WITH THE PENALTIES ATTACHING TO SUCH
7264-92316-0014.flac,THEY SAID THIS ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE LIFE OF FRANCE IS AT LEAST AS CATHOLIC AS THE LIFE OF GREAT BRITAIN IS PLUTOCRATIC OR THE LIFE OF SWITZERLAND DEMOCRATIC AND THEY SAID IT BECAUSE THEY AROSE AFTER THE CAPITALIST PRESS NEUTRAL IN RELIGION AS IN EVERY VITAL THING
7264-92316-0015.flac,HAD CAPTURED THE WHOLE FIELD THE FIRST PROPAGANDISTS THEN DID NOT STAND UP TO THE OFFICIAL PRESS AS EQUALS THEY CREPT IN AS INFERIORS OR RATHER AS OPEN EX CENTRICS
7264-92316-0016.flac,FOR VICTORIAN ENGLAND AND THIRD EMPIRE FRANCE FALSELY PROCLAIMED THE REPRESENTATIVE QUALITY OF THE OFFICIAL PRESS TO THE HONOUR OF THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENT THE SOCIALIST FREE PRESS WAS THE FIRST TO STAND UP AS AN EQUAL AGAINST THE GIANTS
7264-92316-0017.flac,TO PAPERS LIKE THE DAILY TELEGRAPH OR THE TIMES WITH THE EPITHET CAPITALIST PUT AFTER THEM IN BRACKETS I THOUGHT THEN IT WAS THE GIVING OF AN ABNORMAL EPITHET TO A NORMAL THING
7264-92316-0018.flac,BUT I NOW KNOW THAT THESE SMALL SOCIALIST FREE PAPERS WERE TALKING THE PLAINEST COMMON SENSE WHEN THEY SPECIFICALLY EMPHASIZED AS CAPITALIST THE FALSEHOODS AND SUPPRESSIONS OF THEIR GREAT CONTEMPORARIES
7264-92316-0019.flac,FROM THE SOCIALIST POINT OF VIEW THE LEADING FACT ABOUT THE INSINCERITY OF THE GREAT OFFICIAL PAPERS IS THAT THIS INSINCERITY IS CAPITALIST JUST AS FROM A CATHOLIC POINT OF VIEW THE LEADING FACT ABOUT IT WAS AND IS THAT IT IS ANTI CATHOLIC
7264-92316-0020.flac,THOUGH HOWEVER CERTAIN OF THE SOCIALIST FREE PAPERS THUS BOLDLY TOOK UP A STANDPOINT OF MORAL EQUALITY WITH THE OTHERS THEIR ATTITUDE WAS EXCEPTIONAL
7264-92316-0021.flac,THE GREAT DAILIES WERE THOUGHT GREY NOT WICKED ONLY GENERAL AND VAGUE THE FREE PRESS IN ITS BEGINNINGS DID NOT ATTACK AS AN ENEMY IT ONLY TIMIDLY CLAIMED TO BE HEARD IT REGARDED ITSELF AS A SPECIALITY IT WAS HUMBLE AND THERE WENT WITH IT A MASS OF EX CENTRIC STUFF
7264-92316-0022.flac,IF ONE PASSES IN REVIEW ALL THE FREE PRESS JOURNALS WHICH OWED THEIR EXISTENCE IN ENGLAND AND FRANCE ALONE TO THIS MOTIVE OF PROPAGANDA ONE FINDS MANY SIDE SHOWS AS IT WERE BESIDE THE MAIN MOTIVES OF LOCAL OR RACE PATRIOTISM RELIGION OR SOCIALIST CONVICTION
7264-92316-0023.flac,YOU HAVE THE SINGLE TAX PAPERS YOU HAVE THE TEETOTAL PAPERS AND REALLY IT IS A WONDER THAT YOU HAVE NOT YET ALSO HAD THE ICONOCLASTS AND THE DIABOLISTS PRODUCING PAPERS THE RATIONALIST AND THE ATHEIST PROPAGANDA I RECKON AMONG THE RELIGIOUS
7264-92316-0024.flac,WE MAY TAKE IT THEN THAT PROPAGANDA WAS IN ORDER OF TIME THE FIRST MOTIVE OF THE FREE PRESS AND THE FIRST CAUSE OF ITS PRODUCTION NOW FROM THIS FACT ARISES A CONSIDERATION OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO OUR SUBJECT
7264-92316-0025.flac,I MEAN THAT THE FREE PRESS HAS HAD STAMPED UPON IT THE CHARACTER OF DISPARATE PARTICULARISM
7264-92316-0026.flac,BUT I KNOW THAT WHEREVER I GET HOLD OF SUCH AN ORGAN IT WILL BE VERY STRONGLY COLOURED WITH THE OPINION OR EVEN FANATICISM OF SOME MINORITY THE FREE PRESS AS A WHOLE
7264-92316-0027.flac,IF YOU ADD IT ALL UP AND CANCEL OUT ONE EXAGGERATED STATEMENT AGAINST ANOTHER DOES GIVE YOU A TRUE VIEW OF THE STATE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH YOU LIVE THE OFFICIAL PRESS TO DAY GIVES YOU AN ABSURDLY FALSE ONE EVERYWHERE
7264-92316-0028.flac,NO ONE OF THEM IS IN ANY SENSE GENERAL OR REALLY NATIONAL THE FREE PRESS GIVES YOU THE TRUTH BUT ONLY IN DISJOINTED SECTIONS FOR IT IS DISPARATE AND IT IS PARTICULARIST IT IS MARKED WITH ISOLATION AND IT IS SO MARKED BECAUSE ITS ORIGIN LAY IN VARIOUS AND MOST DIVERSE PROPAGANDA
7264-92316-0029.flac,BECAUSE IT CAME LATER THAN THE OFFICIAL PRESS OF CAPITALISM AND WAS IN ITS ORIGINS BUT A REACTION AGAINST IT B THE SECOND MOTIVE THAT OF INDIGNATION AGAINST FALSEHOOD CAME TO WORK MUCH LATER THAN THE MOTIVE OF PROPAGANDA
7264-92316-0030.flac,MEN GRADUALLY CAME TO NOTICE THAT ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER OF GREAT PUBLIC INTEREST SOMETIMES OF VITAL PUBLIC INTEREST WAS DELIBERATELY SUPPRESSED IN THE PRINCIPAL GREAT OFFICIAL PAPERS AND THAT POSITIVE FALSEHOODS WERE INCREASINGLY SUGGESTED OR STATED
7264-92316-0031.flac,THERE WAS MORE THAN THIS FOR LONG THE OWNER OF A NEWSPAPER HAD FOR THE MOST PART BEEN CONTENT TO REGARD IT AS A REVENUE PRODUCING THING THE EDITOR WAS SUPREME IN MATTERS OF CULTURE AND OPINION TRUE THE EDITOR BEING REVOCABLE AND POOR COULD NOT PRETEND TO FULL POLITICAL POWER
7264-92316-0032.flac,BUT IT WAS A SORT OF DUAL ARRANGEMENT WHICH YET MODIFIED THE POWER OF THE VULGAR OWNER I MYSELF REMEMBER THAT STATE OF AFFAIRS THE EDITOR WHO WAS A GENTLEMAN AND DINED OUT THE PROPRIETOR WHO WAS A LORD AND NERVOUS WHEN HE MET A GENTLEMAN
7264-92316-0033.flac,THE EDITOR BECAME AND NOW IS A MERE MOUTHPIECE OF THE PROPRIETOR EDITORS SUCCEED EACH OTHER RAPIDLY OF GREAT PAPERS TO DAY THE EDITOR'S NAME OF THE MOMENT IS HARDLY KNOWN
7264-92316-0034.flac,BUT NOT A CABINET MINISTER THAT COULD NOT PASS AN EXAMINATION IN THE LIFE VICES VULNERABILITY FORTUNE INVESTMENTS AND FAVOURS OF THE OWNER THE CHANGE WAS RAPIDLY ADMITTED IT CAME QUICKLY BUT THOROUGHLY AT LAST LIKE MOST RAPID DEVELOPMENTS IT EXCEEDED ITSELF
7264-92316-0035.flac,MEN OWNING THE CHIEF NEWSPAPERS COULD BE HEARD BOASTING OF THEIR POWER IN PUBLIC AS AN ADMITTED THING AND AS THIS POWER WAS RECOGNIZED AND AS IT GREW WITH TIME AND EXPERIMENT IT BRED A REACTION
7264-92316-0036.flac,WHY SHOULD THIS OR THAT VULGARIAN MEN BEGAN TO SAY EXERCISE AND BOAST OF THE POWER TO KEEP THE PEOPLE IGNORANT UPON MATTERS VITAL TO US ALL TO DISTORT
7264-92316-0037.flac,TO LIE THE SHEER NECESSITY OF GETTING CERTAIN TRUTHS TOLD WHICH THESE POWERFUL BUT HIDDEN FELLOWS REFUSED TO TELL WAS A FORCE WORKING AT HIGH POTENTIAL AND ALMOST COMPELLING THE PRODUCTION OF FREE PAPERS SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE BIG OFFICIAL ONES
7264-92316-0038.flac,THAT IS WHY YOU NEARLY ALWAYS FIND THE FREE PRESS DIRECTED BY MEN OF INTELLIGENCE AND CULTIVATION OF EXCEPTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND CULTIVATION AND THAT IS WHERE IT CONTRASTS MOST WITH ITS OPPONENTS C
7264-92316-0039.flac,BUT ONLY A LITTLE LATER THAN THIS SECOND MOTIVE OF INDIGNATION AGAINST FALSEHOOD AND ACTING WITH EQUAL FORCE THOUGH UPON FEWER MEN WAS THE THIRD MOTIVE OF FREEDOM OF INDIGNATION AGAINST ARBITRARY POWER
7264-92316-0040.flac,BUT IT IS INTOLERABLE THAT SIMILAR POWER SHOULD RESIDE IN THE HANDS OF OBSCURE NOBODIES ABOUT WHOM NO ILLUSION COULD POSSIBLY EXIST WHOSE TYRANNY IS NOT ADMITTED OR PUBLIC AT ALL WHO DO NOT EVEN TAKE THE RISK OF EXPOSING THEIR FEATURES AND TO WHOM NO RESPONSIBILITY WHATEVER ATTACHES
7264-92316-0041.flac,THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAS SO PROVIDED THE THIRD AND PERHAPS THE MOST POWERFUL MOTIVE FOR THE CREATION OF A FREE PRESS
7264-92316-0042.flac,UNFORTUNATELY IT COULD AFFECT ONLY VERY FEW MEN WITH THE MASS EVEN OF WELL EDUCATED AND OBSERVANT MEN THE FEELING CREATED BY THE NOVEL POWER OF THE GREAT PAPERS WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A VAGUE ILL EASE
7264-92316-0043.flac,THEY HAD A GENERAL CONCEPTION THAT THE OWNER OF A WIDELY CIRCULATED POPULAR NEWSPAPER COULD AND DID BLACKMAIL THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN MAKE OR UNMAKE THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN BY GRANTING OR REFUSING HIM THE LIMELIGHT
7264-92316-0044.flac,DISPOSE OF CABINETS NOMINATE ABSURD MINISTERS BUT THE PARTICULAR VIVID CONCRETE INSTANCES THAT SPECIALLY MOVE MEN TO ACTION WERE HIDDEN FROM THEM ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE ACQUAINTED WITH SUCH PARTICULAR TRUTHS
7264-92316-0045.flac,BUT THAT SMALL NUMBER KNEW VERY WELL THAT WE WERE THUS IN REALITY GOVERNED BY MEN RESPONSIBLE TO NO ONE AND HIDDEN FROM PUBLIC BLAME
6531-61334-0000.flac,THE SLEEPERS OPEN THEIR EYES AND RAISE THEMSELVES ON THEIR ELBOWS THEN THE SHEPHERD HEARS A WARNING VOICE WHICH COMES AND GOES LIKE THE WIND SAYING IF THE HORN IS BLOWN ONCE AGAIN THE WORLD WILL BE UPSET ALTOGETHER
6531-61334-0001.flac,TERRIFIED BY THE VOICE AND THE FEROCIOUS APPEARANCE OF THE HEROES THE SHEPHERD RETREATS HURRIEDLY LOCKING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
6531-61334-0002.flac,SHALMANESER SHAMASH ADAD ASHUR DAN
6531-61334-0003.flac,THE SYRO CAPPADOCIAN HITTITES HAD GROWN ONCE AGAIN POWERFUL AND PROSPEROUS BUT NO GREAT LEADER LIKE SUBBILULIUMA AROSE TO WELD THE VARIOUS STATES INTO AN EMPIRE
6531-61334-0004.flac,SO AS TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF THE MINGLED PEOPLES FROM THE OPERATIONS OF THE AGGRESSIVE AND AMBITIOUS WAR LORDS OF ASSYRIA ONE KINGDOM HAD ITS CAPITAL AT HAMATH AND ANOTHER AT CARCHEMISH ON THE EUPHRATES THE KINGDOM OF TABAL FLOURISHED IN CILICIA KHILAKKU
6531-61334-0005.flac,IT INCLUDED SEVERAL CITY STATES LIKE TARSUS TIANA AND COMANA KAMMANU FARTHER WEST WAS THE DOMINION OF THE THRACO PHRYGIAN MUSKI THE TRIBES ROUND THE SHORES OF LAKE VAN
6531-61334-0006.flac,HAD ASSERTED THEMSELVES AND EXTENDED THEIR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE THE STATE OF URARTU WAS OF GROWING IMPORTANCE AND THE NAIRI TRIBES HAD SPREAD ROUND THE SOUTH EASTERN SHORES OF LAKE VAN
6531-61334-0007.flac,THE NORTHERN FRONTIER OF ASSYRIA WAS CONTINUALLY MENACED BY GROUPS OF INDEPENDENT HILL STATES WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN IRRESISTIBLE HAD THEY OPERATED TOGETHER AGAINST A COMMON ENEMY BUT WERE LIABLE TO BE EXTINGUISHED WHEN ATTACKED IN DETAIL
6531-61334-0008.flac,A NUMBER OF ARAMAEAN KINGDOMS HAD COME INTO EXISTENCE IN MESOPOTAMIA AND THROUGHOUT SYRIA
6531-61334-0009.flac,WHEN ASHUR NATSIR PAL THE THIRD
6531-61334-0010.flac,GROUPS OF THE ARAMAEANS HAD ACQUIRED A HIGH DEGREE OF CULTURE AND BECOME TRADERS AND ARTISANS
6531-61334-0011.flac,ACCUSTOMED FOR GENERATIONS TO DESERT WARFARE THEY WERE FEARLESS WARRIORS THEIR ARMIES HAD GREAT MOBILITY BEING COMPOSED MOSTLY OF MOUNTED INFANTRY AND WERE NOT EASILY OVERPOWERED BY THE ASSYRIAN FORCES OF FOOTMEN
6531-61334-0012.flac,THE FORMER HAD RAIDED NORTH SYRIA AND APPARENTLY PENETRATED AS FAR AS THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST IN CONSEQUENCE HE CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH BABYLONIA BUT HE ULTIMATELY FORMED AN ALLIANCE WITH THAT KINGDOM HIS SON TUKULTI NINIP
6531-61334-0013.flac,OPERATED IN SOUTHERN MESOPOTAMIA
6531-61334-0014.flac,IN THE NORTH HE HAD TO DRIVE BACK INVADING BANDS OF THE MUSKI
6531-61334-0015.flac,A SURE INDICATION THAT ASSYRIA WAS ONCE AGAIN BECOMING POWERFUL IN NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AND THE REGIONS TOWARDS ARMENIA ASHUR NATSIR PAL THE THIRD
6531-61334-0016.flac,INAUGURATED A VERITABLE REIGN OF TERROR IN MESOPOTAMIA AND NORTHERN SYRIA HIS METHODS OF DEALING WITH REVOLTING TRIBES WERE OF A MOST SAVAGE CHARACTER CHIEFS WERE SKINNED ALIVE AND WHEN HE SACKED THEIR CITIES
6531-61334-0017.flac,NOT ONLY FIGHTING MEN BUT WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE EITHER SLAUGHTERED OR BURNED AT THE STAKE IT IS NOT SURPRISING TO FIND THEREFORE THAT ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THE KINGS OF PETTY STATES MADE SUBMISSION TO HIM WITHOUT RESISTANCE AS SOON AS HE INVADED THEIR DOMAINS
6531-61334-0018.flac,IN HIS FIRST YEAR HE OVERRAN THE MOUNTAINOUS DISTRICT BETWEEN LAKE VAN AND THE UPPER SOURCES OF THE TIGRIS BUBU THE REBEL SON OF THE GOVERNOR OF NISHTUN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONER WAS TRANSPORTED TO ARBELA WHERE HE WAS SKINNED ALIVE
6531-61334-0019.flac,LIKE HIS FATHER ASHUR NATSIR PAL FOUGHT AGAINST THE MUSKI WHOSE POWER WAS DECLINING THEN HE TURNED SOUTHWARD FROM THE BORDERS OF ASIA MINOR AND DEALT WITH A REBELLION IN NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AN ARAMAEAN PRETENDER NAMED AKHIABABA
6531-61334-0020.flac,HAD ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AT SURU IN THE REGION TO THE EAST OF THE EUPHRATES ENCLOSED BY ITS TRIBUTARIES THE KHABAR AND THE BALIKH HE HAD COME FROM THE NEIGHBOURING ARAMAEAN STATE OF BIT ADINI AND WAS PREPARING IT WOULD APPEAR
6531-61334-0021.flac,TO FORM A POWERFUL CONFEDERACY AGAINST THE ASSYRIANS WHEN ASHUR NATSIR PAL APPROACHED SURU A PART OF ITS POPULATION WELCOMED HIM HE ENTERED THE CITY SEIZED THE PRETENDER AND MANY OF HIS FOLLOWERS

6531-61334-0078.flac,THE VARIOUS RIVAL KINGDOMS OF SYRIA UNITED AGAINST HIM AND AN ARMY OF SEVENTY THOUSAND ALLIES ATTEMPTED TO THWART HIS PROGRESS AT QARQAR ON THE ORONTES ALTHOUGH SHALMANESER CLAIMED A VICTORY ON THIS OCCASION
6531-61334-0079.flac,IT WAS OF NO GREAT ADVANTAGE TO HIM FOR HE WAS UNABLE TO FOLLOW IT UP
6531-61334-0080.flac,OF DAMASCUS AND AHAB OF ISRAEL AKHABBU

6531-61334-0083.flac,DURING THIS PERIOD BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE TWO KINGDOMS HAD BEEN DRAWN TOGETHER
6531-61334-0084.flac,AFTER REPULSING THE SYRIAN ALLIES AT QARQAR
6531-61334-0085.flac,SHALMANESER THE THIRD OF ASSYRIA FOUND IT NECESSARY TO INVADE BABYLONIA
6531-61334-0086.flac,OF THAT KINGDOM AND WAS THUS ABLE TO OPERATE IN THE NORTH WEST WITHOUT FEAR OF COMPLICATIONS WITH THE RIVAL CLAIMANT OF MESOPOTAMIA

6531-61334-0090.flac,AND COMPELLED TO PAY ANNUAL TRIBUTE IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR SHALMANESER HAD TO LEAD AN EXPEDITION INTO NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AND SUPPRESS A FRESH REVOLT IN THAT TROUBLED REGION BUT THE WESTERN ALLIES SOON GATHERED STRENGTH AGAIN
6531-61334-0091.flac,HE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO RETURN WITH A GREAT ARMY BUT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING ANY PERMANENT SUCCESS ALTHOUGH HE PUT HIS ENEMIES TO FLIGHT THE VARIOUS WESTERN KINGDOMS INCLUDING DAMASCUS ISRAEL
6531-61334-0092.flac,REMAINED UNCONQUERED AND CONTINUED TO CONSPIRE AGAINST HIM THE RESISTING POWER OF THE SYRIAN ALLIES HOWEVER WAS BEING GREATLY WEAKENED BY INTERNAL REVOLTS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN STIRRED UP BY ASSYRIAN EMISSARIES

6531-61334-0098.flac,AND THE DRIVING IS LIKE THE DRIVING OF JEHU THE SON OF NIMSHI FOR HE DRIVETH FURIOUSLY KING JORAM WENT OUT HIMSELF TO MEET THE FAMOUS CHARIOTEER
6531-61334-0099.flac,WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED HE MADE OFFERINGS THERE TO HADAD THE LOCAL THOR AND THEN SUDDENLY MARCHED SOUTHWARD HAZAEL WENT OUT TO OPPOSE THE ADVANCING ASSYRIANS AND CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH THEM IN THE VICINITY OF MOUNT HERMON

6531-61334-0103.flac,SHOWS THAT THE UNPRONOUNCED ALEPH AT THE END WAS AT THAT TIME SOUNDED
6531-61334-0104.flac,JEHUA SHALMANESER DID NOT AGAIN ATTACK DAMASCUS HIS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE WAS THEREFORE CONFINED TO NORTH SYRIA
6531-61334-0105.flac,HIS REVOLT RECEIVED THE SUPPORT OF THE ORTHODOX HEBREWS AND HE BEGAN WELL BY INAUGURATING REFORMS IN THE NORTHERN KINGDOM WITH PURPOSE APPARENTLY TO RE ESTABLISH THE WORSHIP OF DAVID'S GOD HE PERSECUTED THE PROPHETS OF BAAL BUT SOON BECAME A BACKSLIDER
6531-61334-0106.flac,FOR ALTHOUGH HE STAMPED OUT THE PHOENICIAN RELIGION HE BEGAN TO WORSHIP THE GOLDEN CALVES THAT WERE IN BETHEL AND THAT WERE IN DAN
6531-61334-0107.flac,OF THE IDOLATORS OF THE ANCIENT CULT OF THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN THE CROWN OF JUDAH HAD BEEN SEIZED BY THE ISRAELITISH QUEEN MOTHER
6531-61334-0108.flac,BUT ANOTHER WOMAN THWARTED THE COMPLETION OF HER MONSTROUS DESIGN
6531-61334-0109.flac,THE KING'S SON AND PUT UPON HIM THE CROWN AND GAVE HIM THE TESTIMONY AND MADE HIM KING AND JEHOIADA AND HIS SONS ANOINTED HIM AND SAID GOD SAVE THE KING

6531-61334-0115.flac,AND HE DELIVERED THEM INTO THE HAND OF BEN HADAD THE SON OF HAZAEL ALL THEIR DAYS THEN JEHOAHAZ REPENTED HE BESOUGHT THE LORD AND THE LORD HEARKENED UNTO HIM FOR HE SAW THE OPPRESSION OF ISRAEL

6531-61334-0117.flac,TRIBES OF THE MEDES CAME UNDER HIS POWER
6531-61334-0118.flac,LIKE THE FRONTIER TRIBES OF INDIA AGAINST THE BRITISH TROOPS THE KINGDOM OF URARTU WAS GROWING MORE AND MORE POWERFUL

6531-61334-0122.flac,AFTER FOUR YEARS OF CIVIL WAR SHALMANESER DIED HIS CHOSEN HEIR
6531-61334-0123.flac,WHEN AT LENGTH THE NEW KING HAD STAMPED OUT THE LAST EMBERS OF REVOLT WITHIN THE KINGDOM HE HAD TO UNDERTAKE THE RECONQUEST OF THOSE PROVINCES WHICH IN THE INTERVAL
6531-61334-0124.flac,URARTU IN THE NORTH HAD GROWN MORE AGGRESSIVE THE SYRIANS WERE OPENLY DEFIANT THE MEDES WERE CONDUCTING BOLD RAIDS
6531-61334-0125.flac,SHAMSHI ADAD HOWEVER

4640-19189-0001.flac,STILL HIS MIND IN THE SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C HAD ENDED BY UNDERGOING A CERTAIN POLARIZATION FROM COMBEFERRE'S IDEAS FOR SOME TIME PAST HE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY EMERGING FROM THE NARROW FORM OF DOGMA

4640-19189-0027.flac,A HEAP OF IDEAS AND A HEAP OF WOES HERE MISERY MEETS THE IDEAL THE DAY EMBRACES THE NIGHT AND SAYS TO IT I AM ABOUT TO DIE AND THOU SHALT BE BORN AGAIN WITH ME
4640-19189-0028.flac,FROM THE EMBRACE OF ALL DESOLATIONS FAITH LEAPS FORTH SUFFERINGS BRING HITHER THEIR AGONY AND IDEAS THEIR IMMORTALITY THIS AGONY AND THIS IMMORTALITY ARE ABOUT TO JOIN
4640-19189-0029.flac,AND CONSTITUTE OUR DEATH BROTHERS HE WHO DIES HERE DIES IN THE RADIANCE OF THE FUTURE AND WE ARE ENTERING A TOMB ALL FLOODED WITH THE DAWN
4640-19189-0030.flac,HIS LIPS CONTINUED TO MOVE SILENTLY AS THOUGH HE WERE TALKING TO HIMSELF WHICH CAUSED THEM ALL TO GAZE ATTENTIVELY AT HIM IN THE ENDEAVOR TO HEAR MORE THERE WAS NO APPLAUSE
4640-19189-0031.flac,JAVERT LACONIC
4640-19189-0032.flac,LET THE READER RECALL THE STATE OF HIS SOUL WE HAVE JUST RECALLED IT EVERYTHING WAS A VISION TO HIM NOW HIS JUDGMENT WAS DISTURBED
4640-19189-0033.flac,MARIUS LET US INSIST ON THIS POINT WAS UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT DARK WINGS WHICH ARE SPREAD OVER THOSE IN THE DEATH AGONY HE FELT THAT HE HAD ENTERED THE TOMB
4640-19189-0034.flac,IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS ALREADY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL AND HE NO LONGER BEHELD THE FACES OF THE LIVING EXCEPT WITH THE EYES OF ONE DEAD
4640-19189-0035.flac,WHAT HAD HE COME THERE TO DO MARIUS DID NOT ADDRESS ALL THESE QUESTIONS TO HIMSELF BESIDES SINCE OUR DESPAIR HAS THIS PECULIARITY THAT IT ENVELOPS OTHERS AS WELL AS OURSELVES
4640-19189-0036.flac,AND HAD NOT EVEN THE AIR OF HEARING HIM WHEN MARIUS RAISED HIS VOICE TO SAY I KNOW HIM
4640-19189-0037.flac,AND IF SUCH A WORD CAN BE USED FOR SUCH IMPRESSIONS WE SHOULD SAY THAT IT PLEASED HIM HE HAD ALWAYS FELT THE ABSOLUTE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ADDRESSING THAT ENIGMATICAL MAN WHO WAS IN HIS EYES
4640-19189-0038.flac,BOTH EQUIVOCAL AND IMPOSING MOREOVER IT HAD BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE HE HAD SEEN HIM
4640-19189-0039.flac,THE FIVE CHOSEN MEN LEFT THE BARRICADE BY WAY OF MONDETOUR LANE
4640-19189-0040.flac,ONE OF THEM WEPT AS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE BEFORE SETTING OUT THEY EMBRACED THOSE WHO REMAINED WHEN THE FIVE MEN SENT BACK TO LIFE HAD TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE
4640-19189-0041.flac,HE ENTERED THE TAP ROOM
4640-19189-0042.flac,JAVERT REPLIED WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME WAIT WE NEED ALL OUR CARTRIDGES JUST AT PRESENT THEN GIVE ME A DRINK SAID JAVERT
4640-19189-0043.flac,THEY ADDED TO THE SYSTEM OF LIGATURES WHICH RENDERED EVERY ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE IMPOSSIBLE THAT SORT OF BOND WHICH IS CALLED IN PRISONS A MARTINGALE WHICH STARTING AT THE NECK
4640-19189-0044.flac,FORKS ON THE STOMACH AND MEETS THE HANDS AFTER PASSING BETWEEN THE LEGS WHILE THEY WERE BINDING JAVERT A MAN STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD WAS SURVEYING HIM WITH SINGULAR ATTENTION
4640-19188-0000.flac,CHAPTER FOUR MINUS FIVE PLUS ONE
4640-19188-0001.flac,STILL GREAT AS WAS THIS OMNIPOTENCE A MURMUR AROSE
4640-19188-0002.flac,HE RESUMED HAUGHTILY LET THOSE WHO ARE AFRAID OF NOT NUMBERING MORE THAN THIRTY SAY SO THE MURMURS REDOUBLED
4640-19188-0003.flac,YOU WOULD FALL IN WITH SOME GRAND GUARD OF THE LINE OR THE SUBURBS
4640-19188-0004.flac,ENTERED THE TAP ROOM THEY EMERGED THENCE A MOMENT LATER

4640-19188-0008.flac,AND AS SOON AS IT TOUCHES YOUR NEIGHBORS SUICIDE IS MURDER THINK OF THE LITTLE BLOND HEADS THINK OF THE WHITE LOCKS
4640-19188-0009.flac,ON THE FIFTH FLOOR AND ON THE PANE THE QUIVERING SHADOW OF THE HEAD OF AN OLD WOMAN WHO HAD THE AIR OF HAVING SPENT THE NIGHT IN WATCHING PERHAPS SHE IS THE MOTHER OF SOME ONE OF YOU
4640-19188-0010.flac,LET HIM FEEL AT EASE THE TASK HERE WILL BE PERFORMED ALL THE SAME WHEN ONE SUPPORTS ONE'S RELATIVES BY ONE'S TOIL ONE HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO SACRIFICE ONE'S SELF

4640-19188-0017.flac,AND SHAKE HANDS WITH US AND TAKE THEMSELVES OFF AND LEAVE US HERE ALONE TO ATTEND TO THIS AFFAIR I KNOW WELL THAT COURAGE IS REQUIRED TO LEAVE THAT IT IS HARD BUT THE HARDER IT IS THE MORE MERITORIOUS
4640-19188-0018.flac,YOU SAY I HAVE A GUN I AM AT THE BARRICADE SO MUCH THE WORSE I SHALL REMAIN THERE SO MUCH THE WORSE IS EASILY SAID MY FRIENDS THERE IS A MORROW YOU WILL NOT BE HERE TO MORROW
4640-19188-0019.flac,BUT YOUR FAMILIES WILL AND WHAT SUFFERINGS SEE HERE IS A PRETTY HEALTHY CHILD WITH CHEEKS LIKE AN APPLE WHO BABBLES PRATTLES CHATTERS WHO LAUGHS WHO SMELLS SWEET BENEATH YOUR KISS
4640-19188-0020.flac,AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT BECOMES OF HIM WHEN HE IS ABANDONED I HAVE SEEN ONE A VERY SMALL CREATURE NO TALLER THAN THAT HIS FATHER WAS DEAD POOR PEOPLE HAD TAKEN HIM IN OUT OF CHARITY
4640-19188-0021.flac,AND WHOSE PIPE YOU KNOW WAS OF MASTIC AND YELLOW CLAY HIS BREATHING WAS HOARSE HIS FACE LIVID HIS LIMBS FLACCID HIS BELLY PROMINENT HE SAID NOTHING IF YOU SPOKE TO HIM HE DID NOT ANSWER
4640-19188-0022.flac,HE IS DEAD HE WAS TAKEN TO THE NECKER HOSPITAL WHERE I SAW HIM I WAS HOUSE SURGEON IN THAT HOSPITAL
4640-19188-0023.flac,THAT POOR BRAT I REMEMBER AND I SEEM TO SEE HIM NOW WHEN HE LAY NUDE ON THE DISSECTING TABLE HOW HIS RIBS STOOD OUT ON HIS SKIN LIKE THE GRAVES BENEATH THE GRASS IN A CEMETERY
4640-19188-0024.flac,STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE MORTALITY AMONG ABANDONED CHILDREN IS FIFTY FIVE PER CENT I REPEAT IT IS A QUESTION OF WOMEN IT CONCERNS MOTHERS IT CONCERNS YOUNG GIRLS IT CONCERNS LITTLE CHILDREN
4640-19188-0025.flac,BUT YOU ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS WORLD THERE ARE OTHER BEINGS OF WHOM YOU MUST THINK YOU MUST NOT BE EGOISTS ALL DROPPED THEIR HEADS WITH A GLOOMY AIR
4640-19188-0026.flac,STRANGE CONTRADICTIONS OF THE HUMAN HEART AT ITS MOST SUBLIME MOMENTS COMBEFERRE WHO SPOKE THUS WAS NOT AN ORPHAN HE RECALLED THE MOTHERS OF OTHER MEN AND FORGOT HIS OWN
4640-19188-0027.flac,HE WAS ABOUT TO GET HIMSELF KILLED HE WAS AN EGOIST MARIUS FASTING FEVERED HAVING EMERGED IN SUCCESSION FROM ALL HOPE AND HAVING BEEN STRANDED IN GRIEF THE MOST SOMBRE OF SHIPWRECKS
4640-19188-0028.flac,AND CLASSIFIED BY SCIENCE AND WHICH IS TO SUFFERING WHAT VOLUPTUOUSNESS IS TO PLEASURE DESPAIR ALSO HAS ITS ECSTASY MARIUS HAD REACHED THIS POINT
4640-19188-0029.flac,HE BEHELD MEN GOING AND COMING AS THROUGH A FLAME HE HEARD VOICES SPEAKING AS AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABYSS BUT THIS MOVED HIM THERE WAS IN THIS SCENE A POINT WHICH PIERCED AND ROUSED EVEN HIM
4640-19188-0030.flac,HE HAD BUT ONE IDEA NOW TO DIE AND HE DID NOT WISH TO BE TURNED ASIDE FROM IT BUT HE REFLECTED IN HIS GLOOMY SOMNAMBULISM THAT WHILE DESTROYING HIMSELF
4640-19188-0031.flac,IT IS YOUR DUTY RATHER RETORTED THE MAN YOU HAVE TWO SISTERS WHOM YOU MAINTAIN AND AN UNPRECEDENTED CONTROVERSY BROKE FORTH
4640-19188-0032.flac,THIS IS THE REPUBLIC AND UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE REIGNS DO YOU YOURSELVES DESIGNATE THOSE WHO ARE TO GO THEY OBEYED AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MINUTES FIVE WERE UNANIMOUSLY SELECTED
4640-19188-0033.flac,AND STEPPED OUT OF THE RANKS THERE ARE FIVE OF THEM EXCLAIMED MARIUS THERE WERE ONLY FOUR UNIFORMS WELL BEGAN THE FIVE ONE MUST STAY BEHIND
4640-19188-0034.flac,AND THEN A STRUGGLE AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD REMAIN AND WHO SHOULD FIND REASONS FOR THE OTHERS NOT REMAINING THE GENEROUS QUARREL BEGAN AFRESH YOU HAVE A WIFE WHO LOVES YOU
4640-19188-0035.flac,DO YOU DESIGNATE WHO IS TO REMAIN YES SAID THE FIVE CHOOSE WE WILL OBEY YOU MARIUS DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF ANOTHER EMOTION
4640-19188-0036.flac,WHICH ONE BEHOLDS IN THE DEPTHS OF HISTORY HOVERING OVER THERMOPYLAE
4640-19188-0037.flac,AND MARIUS STUPIDLY COUNTED THEM THERE WERE STILL FIVE OF THEM THEN HIS GLANCE DROPPED TO THE FOUR UNIFORMS AT THAT MOMENT A FIFTH UNIFORM FELL AS IF FROM HEAVEN UPON THE OTHER FOUR
4640-19188-0038.flac,THE FIFTH MAN WAS SAVED
4640-19188-0039.flac,THANKS TO HIS DRESS OF A NATIONAL GUARDSMAN HE HAD MADE HIS WAY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THE SENTINEL STATIONED BY THE INSURGENTS IN THE RUE MONDETOUR HAD NO OCCASION TO GIVE THE ALARM FOR A SINGLE NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
4640-19188-0040.flac,AND HE HAD SILENTLY REMOVED HIS COAT AND FLUNG IT ON THE PILE WITH THE REST THE EMOTION AROUSED WAS INDESCRIBABLE
4640-19187-0000.flac,AND JUNE EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT KNEW A GREAT DEAL MORE ABOUT IT THAN JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO SO THE BARRICADE OF THE
4640-19187-0001.flac,AND AN EMBRYO COMPARED TO THE TWO COLOSSAL BARRICADES WHICH WE HAVE JUST SKETCHED BUT IT WAS FORMIDABLE FOR THAT EPOCH
4640-19187-0002.flac,ALL SORTS OF RUBBISH BROUGHT AND ADDED FROM ALL DIRECTIONS COMPLICATED THE EXTERNAL CONFUSION THE REDOUBT HAD BEEN CLEVERLY MADE OVER INTO A WALL ON THE INSIDE AND A THICKET ON THE OUTSIDE
4640-19187-0003.flac,THE STAIRCASE OF PAVING STONES WHICH PERMITTED ONE TO MOUNT IT LIKE THE WALL OF A CITADEL HAD BEEN RECONSTRUCTED THE BARRICADE HAD BEEN PUT IN ORDER THE TAP ROOM DISENCUMBERED
4640-19187-0004.flac,THE KITCHEN APPROPRIATED FOR THE AMBULANCE THE DRESSING OF THE WOUNDED COMPLETED THE POWDER SCATTERED ON THE GROUND AND ON THE TABLES HAD BEEN GATHERED UP
4640-19187-0005.flac,WHICH ALLOWED THE INSURGENTS TO BREATHE MORE FREELY THEY HAD FOUND MEANS OF TAKING REFUGE IN SOME NEIGHBORING HOUSE THE GREATER PART OF THE WOUNDED WERE ABLE AND WISHED TO FIGHT STILL
4640-19187-0006.flac,ON A LITTER OF MATTRESSES AND TRUSSES OF STRAW IN THE KITCHEN WHICH HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO AN AMBULANCE THERE WERE FIVE MEN GRAVELY WOUNDED TWO OF WHOM WERE MUNICIPAL GUARDSMEN
4640-19187-0007.flac,IN THE INTERIOR OF THIS HALL BARELY LIGHTED BY A CANDLE AT ONE END THE MORTUARY TABLE BEING BEHIND THE POST LIKE A HORIZONTAL BAR
4640-19187-0008.flac,AND MABEUF LYING PRONE THE POLE OF THE OMNIBUS ALTHOUGH SNAPPED OFF BY THE FUSILLADE WAS STILL SUFFICIENTLY UPRIGHT TO ADMIT OF THEIR FASTENING THE FLAG TO IT
4640-19187-0009.flac,THE FIFTY MEN IN THE BARRICADE HAD SPEEDILY EXHAUSTED THE SCANTY PROVISIONS OF THE WINE SHOP DURING THE SIXTEEN HOURS WHICH THEY HAD PASSED THERE
4640-19187-0010.flac,THEY HAD THEN REACHED THE FIRST HOURS OF THAT SPARTAN DAY OF THE SIXTH OF JUNE WHEN IN THE BARRICADE SAINT MERRY JEANNE SURROUNDED BY THE INSURGENTS WHO DEMANDED BREAD REPLIED TO ALL COMBATANTS CRYING SOMETHING TO EAT
4640-19187-0011.flac,WITH WHY
4640-19187-0012.flac,AS THEY COULD NO LONGER EAT
4640-19187-0013.flac,HE INTERDICTED WINE AND PORTIONED OUT THE BRANDY THEY HAD FOUND IN THE CELLAR FIFTEEN FULL BOTTLES HERMETICALLY SEALED
4640-19187-0014.flac,AND IN ORDER THAT NO ONE MIGHT TOUCH THEM HE HAD THEM PLACED UNDER THE TABLE ON WHICH FATHER MABEUF WAS LYING ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THEY RECKONED UP THEIR STRENGTH THERE WERE STILL THIRTY SEVEN OF THEM
4640-19187-0015.flac,THE DAY BEGAN TO DAWN THE TORCH WHICH HAD BEEN REPLACED IN ITS CAVITY IN THE PAVEMENT HAD JUST BEEN EXTINGUISHED THE INTERIOR OF THE BARRICADE THAT SPECIES OF TINY COURTYARD APPROPRIATED FROM THE STREET
4640-19187-0016.flac,THAT TORCH FLICKERING IN THE WIND ANNOYED ME IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF BEING AFRAID THE LIGHT OF TORCHES RESEMBLES THE WISDOM OF COWARDS IT GIVES A BAD LIGHT BECAUSE IT TREMBLES
4640-19187-0017.flac,DAWN AWAKENS MINDS AS IT DOES THE BIRDS ALL BEGAN TO TALK JOLY PERCEIVING A CAT PROWLING ON A GUTTER EXTRACTED PHILOSOPHY FROM IT WHAT IS THE CAT HE EXCLAIMED
4640-19187-0018.flac,IT IS A CORRECTIVE THE GOOD GOD HAVING MADE THE MOUSE SAID HULLO I HAVE COMMITTED A BLUNDER AND SO HE MADE THE CAT THE CAT IS THE ERRATUM OF THE MOUSE
4640-19187-0019.flac,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON BRUTUS CHEREAS STEPHANUS CROMWELL CHARLOTTE CORDAY SAND HAVE ALL HAD THEIR MOMENT OF AGONY WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE
4640-19187-0020.flac,OUR HEARTS QUIVER SO AND HUMAN LIFE IS SUCH A MYSTERY THAT EVEN IN THE CASE OF A CIVIC MURDER EVEN IN A MURDER FOR LIBERATION IF THERE BE SUCH A THING
4640-19187-0021.flac,THE REMORSE FOR HAVING STRUCK A MAN SURPASSES THE JOY OF HAVING SERVED THE HUMAN RACE AND SUCH ARE THE WINDINGS OF THE EXCHANGE OF SPEECH THAT A MOMENT LATER BY A TRANSITION BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH JEAN PROUVAIRE'S VERSES
4640-19187-0022.flac,COMBEFERRE WAS COMPARING THE TRANSLATORS OF THE GEORGICS
4640-19187-0023.flac,COURNAND WITH DELILLE POINTING OUT THE PASSAGES TRANSLATED BY MALFILATRE PARTICULARLY THE PRODIGIES OF CAESAR'S DEATH AND AT THAT WORD CAESAR THE CONVERSATION REVERTED TO BRUTUS
4640-19187-0024.flac,CAESAR SAID COMBEFERRE FELL JUSTLY CICERO WAS SEVERE TOWARDS CAESAR AND HE WAS RIGHT THAT SEVERITY IS NOT DIATRIBE
4640-19187-0025.flac,WHEN MAEVIUS INSULTS VIRGIL WHEN VISE INSULTS MOLIERE WHEN POPE INSULTS SHAKSPEARE WHEN FREDERIC INSULTS VOLTAIRE IT IS AN OLD LAW OF ENVY AND HATRED WHICH IS BEING CARRIED OUT
4640-19187-0026.flac,THE BLADE BUT ANTIQUITY ADMITTED IT CAESAR THE VIOLATOR OF THE RUBICON CONFERRING AS THOUGH THEY CAME FROM HIM THE DIGNITIES WHICH EMANATED FROM THE PEOPLE NOT RISING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE SENATE
4640-19187-0027.flac,COMMITTED THE ACTS OF A KING AND ALMOST OF A TYRANT
4640-19187-0028.flac,CAESAR IS STABBED BY THE SENATORS CHRIST IS CUFFED BY LACKEYS ONE FEELS THE GOD THROUGH THE GREATER OUTRAGE
4640-19187-0029.flac,HE HAD MADE HIS WAY OUT THROUGH MONDETOUR LANE GLIDING ALONG CLOSE TO THE HOUSES THE INSURGENTS WE WILL REMARK WERE FULL OF HOPE
4640-19187-0030.flac,THAN AS TO THEIR CAUSE MOREOVER SUCCOR WAS EVIDENTLY ON THE WAY TO THEM THEY RECKONED ON IT WITH THAT FACILITY OF TRIUMPHANT PROPHECY WHICH IS ONE OF THE SOURCES OF STRENGTH IN THE FRENCH COMBATANT
4640-19187-0031.flac,THEY DIVIDED THE DAY WHICH WAS AT HAND INTO THREE DISTINCT PHASES
4640-19187-0032.flac,AT NOON THE INSURRECTION OF ALL PARIS AT SUNSET REVOLUTION
4640-19187-0033.flac,WHICH RESEMBLED THE WARLIKE HUM OF A HIVE OF BEES
4640-19187-0034.flac,HE RETURNED FROM HIS SOMBRE EAGLE FLIGHT INTO OUTER DARKNESS HE LISTENED FOR A MOMENT TO ALL THIS JOY WITH FOLDED ARMS AND ONE HAND ON HIS MOUTH THEN
4640-19187-0035.flac,FRESH AND ROSY IN THE GROWING WHITENESS OF THE DAWN HE SAID THE WHOLE ARMY OF PARIS IS TO STRIKE A THIRD OF THE ARMY IS BEARING DOWN UPON THE BARRICADES IN WHICH YOU NOW ARE
4640-19187-0036.flac,AS FOR THE POPULACE IT WAS SEETHING YESTERDAY TO DAY IT IS NOT STIRRING THERE IS NOTHING TO EXPECT NOTHING TO HOPE FOR NEITHER FROM A FAUBOURG NOR FROM A REGIMENT YOU ARE ABANDONED
4640-19187-0037.flac,A MOMENT OF INDESCRIBABLE SILENCE ENSUED IN WHICH DEATH MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEARD FLITTING BY THIS MOMENT WAS BRIEF
4640-19187-0038.flac,SO BE IT LET US RAISE THE BARRICADE TO A HEIGHT OF TWENTY FEET AND LET US ALL REMAIN IN IT CITIZENS LET US OFFER THE PROTESTS OF CORPSES
4640-19187-0039.flac,IT WAS HAILED WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC ACCLAMATION NO ONE EVER HAS KNOWN THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO SPOKE THUS HE WAS SOME UNKNOWN BLOUSE WEARER A STRANGER
4640-19187-0040.flac,AT A GIVEN MOMENT UTTERS IN A SUPREME FASHION THE DECISIVE WORD AND WHO VANISHES INTO THE SHADOWS AFTER HAVING REPRESENTED FOR A MINUTE IN A LIGHTNING FLASH THE PEOPLE AND GOD
4640-19187-0041.flac,LET US GET OURSELVES KILLED HERE TO THE VERY LAST MAN
7148-7763-0000.flac,CRISIS IN MY MENTAL HISTORY ONE STAGE ONWARD FOR SOME YEARS AFTER THIS TIME I WROTE VERY LITTLE AND NOTHING REGULARLY FOR PUBLICATION AND GREAT WERE THE ADVANTAGES WHICH I DERIVED FROM THE INTERMISSION
7148-7763-0001.flac,IT WAS OF NO COMMON IMPORTANCE TO ME AT THIS PERIOD TO BE ABLE TO DIGEST AND MATURE MY THOUGHTS FOR MY OWN MIND ONLY WITHOUT ANY IMMEDIATE CALL FOR GIVING THEM OUT IN PRINT HAD I GONE ON WRITING
7148-7763-0002.flac,MIGHT TRULY BE CALLED AN OBJECT IN LIFE TO BE A REFORMER OF THE WORLD MY CONCEPTION OF MY OWN HAPPINESS WAS ENTIRELY IDENTIFIED WITH THIS OBJECT THE PERSONAL SYMPATHIES I WISHED FOR WERE THOSE OF FELLOW LABOURERS
7148-7763-0003.flac,IN THIS ENTERPRISE I ENDEAVOURED TO PICK UP AS MANY FLOWERS AS I COULD BY THE WAY
7148-7763-0004.flac,BUT AS A SERIOUS AND PERMANENT PERSONAL SATISFACTION TO REST UPON MY WHOLE RELIANCE WAS PLACED ON THIS AND I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO FELICITATE MYSELF ON THE CERTAINTY OF A HAPPY LIFE WHICH I ENJOYED
7148-7763-0005.flac,THROUGH PLACING MY HAPPINESS IN SOMETHING DURABLE AND DISTANT IN WHICH SOME PROGRESS MIGHT BE ALWAYS MAKING WHILE IT COULD NEVER BE EXHAUSTED BY COMPLETE ATTAINMENT THIS DID VERY WELL FOR SEVERAL YEARS DURING WHICH THE GENERAL
7148-7763-0006.flac,AS FROM A DREAM IT WAS IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX I WAS IN A DULL STATE OF NERVES SUCH AS EVERYBODY IS OCCASIONALLY LIABLE TO UNSUSCEPTIBLE TO ENJOYMENT OR PLEASURABLE EXCITEMENT ONE OF THOSE MOODS
7148-7763-0007.flac,IN THIS FRAME OF MIND IT OCCURRED TO ME TO PUT THE QUESTION DIRECTLY TO MYSELF SUPPOSE THAT ALL YOUR OBJECTS IN LIFE WERE REALIZED THAT ALL THE CHANGES IN INSTITUTIONS AND OPINIONS WHICH YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO
7148-7763-0008.flac,THE WHOLE FOUNDATION ON WHICH MY LIFE WAS CONSTRUCTED FELL DOWN ALL MY HAPPINESS WAS TO HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE CONTINUAL PURSUIT OF THIS END THE END HAD CEASED TO CHARM AND HOW COULD THERE EVER AGAIN BE ANY INTEREST IN THE MEANS
7148-7763-0009.flac,I AWOKE TO A RENEWED CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE WOFUL FACT I CARRIED IT WITH ME INTO ALL COMPANIES INTO ALL OCCUPATIONS HARDLY ANYTHING HAD POWER TO CAUSE ME EVEN A FEW MINUTES OBLIVION OF IT
7148-7763-0010.flac,FOR SOME MONTHS THE CLOUD SEEMED TO GROW THICKER AND THICKER THE LINES IN COLERIDGE'S DEJECTION I WAS NOT THEN ACQUAINTED WITH THEM EXACTLY DESCRIBE MY CASE A GRIEF WITHOUT A PANG VOID
7148-7763-0011.flac,IN VAIN I SOUGHT RELIEF FROM MY FAVOURITE BOOKS THOSE MEMORIALS OF PAST NOBLENESS AND GREATNESS FROM WHICH I HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO DRAWN STRENGTH AND ANIMATION I READ THEM NOW WITHOUT FEELING
7148-7763-0012.flac,OR WITH THE ACCUSTOMED FEELING MINUS ALL ITS CHARM AND I BECAME PERSUADED THAT MY LOVE OF MANKIND AND OF EXCELLENCE FOR ITS OWN SAKE HAD WORN ITSELF OUT
7148-7763-0013.flac,I SOUGHT NO COMFORT BY SPEAKING TO OTHERS OF WHAT I FELT IF I HAD LOVED ANYONE SUFFICIENTLY TO MAKE CONFIDING MY GRIEFS A NECESSITY I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE CONDITION I WAS
7148-7763-0014.flac,I FELT TOO THAT MINE WAS NOT AN INTERESTING OR IN ANY WAY RESPECTABLE DISTRESS THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT TO ATTRACT SYMPATHY ADVICE
7148-7763-0015.flac,AND I SAW NO USE IN GIVING HIM THE PAIN OF THINKING THAT HIS PLANS HAD FAILED WHEN THE FAILURE WAS PROBABLY IRREMEDIABLE AND AT ALL EVENTS BEYOND THE POWER OF
7148-7763-0016.flac,HIS REMEDIES OF OTHER FRIENDS I HAD AT THAT TIME NONE TO WHOM I HAD ANY HOPE OF MAKING MY CONDITION INTELLIGIBLE IT WAS HOWEVER ABUNDANTLY INTELLIGIBLE TO MYSELF
7148-7763-0017.flac,AND THE MORE I DWELT UPON IT THE MORE HOPELESS IT APPEARED MY COURSE OF STUDY
7148-7763-0018.flac,WHETHER OF A GOOD OR OF A BAD KIND WERE THE RESULTS OF ASSOCIATION THAT WE LOVE ONE THING AND HATE ANOTHER TAKE PLEASURE IN ONE SORT OF ACTION OR CONTEMPLATION
7148-7763-0019.flac,WITH ALL THINGS BENEFICIAL TO THE GREAT WHOLE
7148-7763-0020.flac,ALL THINGS HURTFUL TO IT THIS DOCTRINE APPEARED INEXPUGNABLE BUT IT NOW SEEMED TO ME ON RETROSPECT THAT MY TEACHERS HAD OCCUPIED THEMSELVES
7148-7763-0021.flac,SALUTARY ASSOCIATIONS THEY SEEMED TO HAVE TRUSTED ALTOGETHER TO THE OLD FAMILIAR INSTRUMENTS PRAISE AND BLAME REWARD AND PUNISHMENT NOW
7148-7763-0022.flac,I DID NOT DOUBT THAT BY THESE MEANS BEGUN EARLY AND APPLIED UNREMITTINGLY INTENSE ASSOCIATIONS OF PAIN AND PLEASURE ESPECIALLY OF PAIN MIGHT BE CREATED
7148-7763-0023.flac,AND MIGHT PRODUCE DESIRES AND AVERSIONS CAPABLE OF LASTING UNDIMINISHED TO THE END OF LIFE BUT THERE MUST ALWAYS BE SOMETHING ARTIFICIAL AND CASUAL IN ASSOCIATIONS THUS PRODUCED
7148-7763-0024.flac,WHAT I HAD ALWAYS BEFORE RECEIVED WITH INCREDULITY THAT THE HABIT OF ANALYSIS HAS A TENDENCY TO WEAR AWAY THE FEELINGS AS INDEED IT HAS WHEN NO OTHER MENTAL HABIT IS CULTIVATED
7148-7763-0025.flac,AND THE ANALYSING SPIRIT REMAINS WITHOUT ITS NATURAL COMPLEMENTS AND CORRECTIVES THE VERY EXCELLENCE OF ANALYSIS I ARGUED IS THAT IT TENDS TO WEAKEN AND UNDERMINE WHATEVER IS THE RESULT OF PREJUDICE
7148-7763-0026.flac,THAT IT ENABLES US MENTALLY TO SEPARATE IDEAS WHICH HAVE ONLY CASUALLY CLUNG TOGETHER AND NO ASSOCIATIONS WHATEVER COULD ULTIMATELY RESIST THIS DISSOLVING FORCE
7148-7763-0027.flac,WERE IT NOT THAT WE OWE TO ANALYSIS OUR CLEAREST KNOWLEDGE OF THE PERMANENT SEQUENCES IN NATURE THE REAL CONNEXIONS BETWEEN THINGS NOT DEPENDENT ON OUR WILL AND FEELINGS NATURAL LAWS BY VIRTUE OF WHICH IN MANY CASES
7148-7763-0028.flac,ONE THING IS INSEPARABLE FROM ANOTHER IN FACT WHICH LAWS IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE CLEARLY PERCEIVED AND IMAGINATIVELY REALIZED CAUSE OUR IDEAS OF THINGS WHICH ARE ALWAYS JOINED TOGETHER IN NATURE
7148-7763-0029.flac,TO COHERE MORE AND MORE CLOSELY IN OUR THOUGHTS ANALYTIC HABITS MAY THUS EVEN STRENGTHEN THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CAUSES AND EFFECTS MEANS AND ENDS BUT TEND ALTOGETHER TO WEAKEN THOSE WHICH ARE
7148-7763-0030.flac,TO SPEAK FAMILIARLY A MERE MATTER OF FEELING THEY ARE THEREFORE I THOUGHT FAVOURABLE TO PRUDENCE AND CLEAR SIGHTEDNESS BUT A PERPETUAL WORM AT THE ROOT BOTH OF THE PASSIONS AND OF THE VIRTUES
7148-7763-0031.flac,OF THE ENTIRE INSUFFICIENCY OF WHICH TO MAKE LIFE DESIRABLE NO ONE HAD A STRONGER CONVICTION THAN I HAD THESE WERE THE LAWS OF HUMAN NATURE BY WHICH AS IT SEEMED TO ME
7148-7763-0032.flac,HAD MADE PRECOCIOUS AND PREMATURE ANALYSIS THE INVETERATE HABIT OF MY MIND I WAS THUS AS I SAID TO MYSELF LEFT STRANDED AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF MY VOYAGE WITH A WELL EQUIPPED SHIP
7148-7763-0033.flac,AND A RUDDER BUT NO SAIL WITHOUT ANY REAL DESIRE FOR THE ENDS WHICH I HAD BEEN SO CAREFULLY FITTED OUT TO WORK FOR NO DELIGHT IN VIRTUE OR THE GENERAL GOOD
7148-7763-0034.flac,THE FOUNTAINS OF VANITY AND AMBITION SEEMED TO HAVE DRIED UP WITHIN ME AS COMPLETELY AS THOSE OF BENEVOLENCE I HAD HAD AS I REFLECTED SOME GRATIFICATION OF VANITY AT TOO EARLY AN AGE
7148-7763-0035.flac,AND THERE SEEMED NO POWER IN NATURE SUFFICIENT TO BEGIN THE FORMATION OF MY CHARACTER ANEW AND CREATE IN A MIND NOW IRRETRIEVABLY ANALYTIC
7148-59157-0000.flac,AND IN THE RESULT WE CAN ACCOMPANY KEATS THROUGH THE GLAD AND SAD AND MAD AND BAD HOURS OF HIS SHORT AND MARVELLOUS LIFE
7148-59157-0001.flac,WE ARE STILL LEFT IN THE DARK IT IS TRUE AS TO KEATS'S RACE AND DESCENT WHETHER KEATS'S FATHER CAME TO LONDON FROM CORNWALL OR NOT SIR SIDNEY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DECIDE ON
7148-59157-0002.flac,THE RATHER SHAKY EVIDENCE THAT HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD IF IT SHOULD HEREAFTER TURN OUT THAT KEATS WAS A CORNISHMAN AT ONE REMOVE MATTHEW ARNOLD'S CONJECTURE AS TO THE CELTIC ELEMENT IN HIM
7148-59157-0003.flac,AT THE SIGN OF THE SWAN AND HOOP FINSBURY PAVEMENT AND MARRIED HIS MASTER'S DAUGHTER IT WAS AT THE STABLE AT THE SWAN AND HOOP NOT A PUBLIC HOUSE BY THE WAY BUT A LIVERY STABLE
7148-59157-0004.flac,THAT KEATS WAS PREMATURELY BORN AT THE END OF OCTOBER SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE
7148-59157-0005.flac,HE WAS SCARCELY NINE YEARS OLD WHEN HIS FATHER WAS KILLED BY A FALL FROM A HORSE HE WAS ONLY FOURTEEN WHEN HIS MOTHER WHO HAD RE MARRIED UNHAPPILY AND THEN BEEN SEPARATED FROM HER HUSBAND DIED A VICTIM OF CHRONIC RHEUMATISM AND CONSUMPTION
7148-59157-0006.flac,IT IS FROM HIS MOTHER THAT KEATS SEEMS TO HAVE INHERITED HIS IMPETUOUS AND PASSIONATE NATURE THERE IS THE EVIDENCE OF A CERTAIN WHOLESALE TEA DEALER THE RESPECTABILITY OF WHOSE TRADE MAY HAVE INCLINED HIM TO CENSORIOUSNESS
7148-59157-0007.flac,SHE WAS A PERSON OF UNBRIDLED TEMPERAMENT AND THAT IN HER LATER YEARS SHE FELL INTO LOOSE WAYS AND WAS NO CREDIT TO THE FAMILY THAT SHE HAD OTHER QUALITIES BESIDES THOSE MENTIONED BY THE TEA DEALER IS SHOWN BY THE PASSIONATE AFFECTION
7148-59157-0008.flac,THAT EXISTED BETWEEN HER AND HER SON JOHN ONCE AS A YOUNG CHILD WHEN SHE WAS ORDERED TO BE KEPT QUIET DURING AN ILLNESS HE IS SAID TO HAVE INSISTED ON KEEPING WATCH AT HER DOOR WITH AN OLD SWORD AND ALLOWING NO ONE TO GO IN
7148-59157-0009.flac,AS SHE LAY DYING HE SAT UP WHOLE NIGHTS WITH HER IN A GREAT CHAIR WOULD SUFFER NOBODY TO GIVE HER MEDICINE OR EVEN COOK HER FOOD BUT HIMSELF AND READ NOVELS TO HER IN HER INTERVALS OF EASE
7148-59157-0010.flac,THEIR GRANDFATHER THE PROPRIETOR OF THE LIVERY STABLE
7148-59157-0011.flac,TILL THE AGE OF SIXTEEN AND AFTERWARDS ENABLED HIM TO ATTEND GUY'S HOSPITAL AS A MEDICAL STUDENT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CREDIT THE ACCEPTED STORY THAT HE PASSED ALL HIS BOYHOOD WITHOUT MAKING ANY ATTEMPT
7148-59157-0012.flac,AT WRITING POETRY HE DID NOT BEGIN TO WRITE SAYS SIR SIDNEY COLVIN TILL HE WAS NEAR EIGHTEEN
7148-59157-0013.flac,THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON INDEED IN ALL THE KEATS CIRCLE TO WHOM ONE IS MORE PASSIONATELY GRATEFUL THAN TO COWDEN CLARKE THAT IS FANNY BRAWNE
7148-59157-0014.flac,WITH HIS GENIUS BEFORE THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN WHEN HE MET FANNY BRAWNE FOR THE FIRST TIME NONE THE LESS HAD HE DIED BEFORE THAT DATE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED IN LITERATURE NOT AS A MARVELLOUS ORIGINAL ARTIST
7148-59157-0015.flac,SHE WAS UNQUESTIONABLY HIS GOOD FAIRY AS A POET THIS IS THE ONLY MATTER UPON WHICH ONE IS SERIOUSLY DISPOSED TO QUARREL WITH SIR SIDNEY COLVIN AS A BIOGRAPHER HE DOES NOT EMPHASIZE AS HE OUGHT THE DEBT WE ARE UNDER TO FANNY BRAWNE
7148-59157-0016.flac,AS THE INTENSIFIER OF KEATS'S GENIUS THE MINX AS KEATS IRRITABLY CALLED HER WHO TRANSFORMED HIM IN A FEW MONTHS FROM A POET OF STILL DOUBTFUL FAME INTO A MASTER AND AN IMMORTAL THE ATTACHMENT
7148-59157-0017.flac,SIR SIDNEY THINKS WAS A MISFORTUNE FOR HIM THOUGH HE QUALIFIES THIS BY ADDING THAT SO PROBABLY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES MUST ANY PASSION FOR A WOMAN HAVE BEEN WELL LET US TEST THIS MISFORTUNE BY ITS CONSEQUENCES
7148-59157-0018.flac,IN JANUARY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN HE WROTE THE EVE OF SAINT AGNES DURING THE SPRING OF THAT YEAR HE WROTE THE ODE TO PSYCHE THE ODE ON A GRECIAN URN THE ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE
7148-59157-0019.flac,AND WROTE THE ODE TO AUTUMN
7148-59157-0020.flac,IN OTHER WORDS PRACTICALLY ALL THE FINE GOLD OF KEATS'S WORK WAS PRODUCED IN THE MONTHS IN WHICH HIS PASSION FOR FANNY BRAWNE WAS CONSUMING HIM AS WITH FIRE HIS GREATEST POEMS WE CLEARLY OWE TO THAT HEIGHTENED SENSE OF BEAUTY
7148-59157-0021.flac,WHICH RESULTED FROM HIS TRANSLATION INTO A LOVER IT SEEMS TO ME A TREACHERY TO KEATS'S MEMORY TO BELITTLE A WOMAN WHO WAS AT LEAST THE OCCASION OF SUCH A PASSIONATE EXPENDITURE OF GENIUS SIR SIDNEY COLVIN
7148-59157-0022.flac,DOES HIS BEST TO BE FAIR TO FANNY
7148-59157-0023.flac,AS WELL AS ONE WHO WAS ABLE TO TRANSMUTE IT INTO PERFECT LITERATURE HE SEEMS TO HAVE ADMIRED WOMEN VULGARLY AS CREATURES WHOSE HANDS WERE WAITING TO BE SQUEEZED RATHER THAN AS EQUAL HUMAN BEINGS
7148-59157-0024.flac,WAS ESSENTIALLY A CYNICISM IN THE EXHAUSTED DON JUAN MOOD HENCE KEATS WAS ALMOST DOOMED TO FALL IN LOVE WITH PROVOCATION RATHER THAN WITH WHAT THE VICTORIANS CALLED SOUL HIS DESTINY
7148-59157-0025.flac,WAS NOT TO BE A HAPPY LOVER BUT THE SLAVE OF A MINX IT WAS NOT A SLAVERY WITHOUT DIGNITY HOWEVER IT HAD THE DIGNITY OF TRAGEDY
7148-59157-0026.flac,SIR SIDNEY COLVIN REGRETS THAT THE LOVE LETTERS OF KEATS TO FANNY WERE EVER PUBLISHED IT WOULD BE AS REASONABLE IN MY OPINION
7148-59157-0027.flac,HAS ALMOST NO COUNTERPART IN BIOGRAPHICAL LITERATURE THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING MISS BRAWNE HE WRITES TO BROWN FROM YARMOUTH IS BEYOND EVERYTHING HORRIBLE THE SENSE OF DARKNESS COMING OVER ME
7148-59157-0028.flac,I ETERNALLY SEE HER FIGURE ETERNALLY VANISHING AND WHEN HE REACHES NAPLES HE WRITES TO THE SAME FRIEND I CAN BEAR TO DIE I CANNOT BEAR TO LEAVE HER O GOD
7148-59157-0029.flac,MY IMAGINATION IS HORRIBLY VIVID ABOUT HER I SEE HER I HEAR HER O THAT I COULD BE BURIED NEAR WHERE SHE LIVES I AM AFRAID TO WRITE TO HER
7148-59157-0030.flac,TO RECEIVE A LETTER FROM HER TO SEE HER HANDWRITING WOULD BREAK MY HEART EVEN TO HEAR OF HER ANYHOW TO SEE HER NAME WRITTEN WOULD BE MORE THAN I CAN BEAR
7148-59157-0031.flac,SANS MERCI SIR SIDNEY IS ALL IN FAVOUR AND THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR HIS PREFERENCE OF THE EARLIER VERSION WHICH BEGINS O WHAT CAN AIL THEE KNIGHT AT ARMS ALONE AND PALELY LOITERING
7148-59157-0032.flac,BUT HE DOES NOT PERCEIVE THE REASONS THAT LED KEATS TO ALTER THIS IN THE VERSION HE PUBLISHED IN LEIGH HUNT'S INDICATOR TO AH WHAT CAN AIL THEE WRETCHED WIGHT AND SO ON
7148-59157-0033.flac,TO ACCUSE HUNT OF WISHING TO ALTER KNIGHT AT ARMS TO WRETCHED WIGHT SEEMS TO ME UNWARRANTABLE GUESSING SURELY A MUCH MORE LIKELY EXPLANATION IS THAT KEATS
7148-59157-0034.flac,EVERY EDITION OF KEATS OUGHT TO CONTAIN BOTH VERSIONS JUST AS IT OUGHT TO CONTAIN BOTH VERSIONS OF HYPERION NOTHING THAT I HAVE WRITTEN WILL BE REGARDED I TRUST AS
7148-59157-0035.flac,DEPRECIATING THE ESSENTIAL EXCELLENCE POWER AND IN ITS SCHOLARLY WAY EVEN THE GREATNESS OF SIR SIDNEY COLVIN'S BOOK BUT A CERTAIN FALSE EMPHASIS HERE AND THERE
7148-59157-0036.flac,AND HIS LUXURIOUS LOVE OF BEAUTY
7148-59157-0037.flac,HIS MORBIDNESS HIS MAWKISHNESS HIS FASCINATION AS BY SERPENTS ON THE OTHER BUT IN THE RESULTANT PORTRAIT IT IS A TOO RESPECTABLE AND VIRILE KEATS THAT EMERGES KEATS WAS MORE VIRILE AS A MAN
7148-59157-0038.flac,THAN IS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD HE DOES NOT OWE HIS IMMORTALITY TO HIS VIRILITY HOWEVER HE OWES IT TO HIS SERVITUDE TO GOLDEN IMAGES TO HIS CITIZENSHIP OF THE WORLD OF THE SENSES TO HIS BONDAGE TO PHYSICAL LOVE
7148-59157-0039.flac,HAD HE LIVED LONGER HE MIGHT HAVE INVADED OTHER WORLDS HIS RECASTING OF HYPERION OPENS WITH A CRY OF DISTRUST IN THE ARTIST WHO IS CONTENT TO LIVE IN THE LITTLE WORLD OF HIS ART
7148-59157-0040.flac,WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN SURPASSED IN LITERATURE THAT HIS OWN ACHIEVEMENT LIES HE IS GREAT AMONG THE PAGANS NOT AMONG THE PROPHETS UNLESS WE KEEP THIS CLEARLY IN MIND OUR PRAISE OF HIM WILL NOT BE APPRECIATION
7148-59157-0041.flac,IT WILL BE BUT A SOUNDING FUNERAL SPEECH INSTEAD OF COMMUNION WITH A LOVELY AND BROKEN SPIRIT
7148-82991-0000.flac,THE BUTCHER AND HOW HE WAS CAST INTO THE VAULT OF THE CURFEW TOWER TURNING OFF ON THE RIGHT THE EARL AND HIS COMPANION CONTINUED TO DESCEND THE HILL UNTIL THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THE GARTER

7148-82991-0004.flac,IN RIGHT MERRY SORT I LOVE THE ROYAL BULLY AND WILL DRINK HIS HEALTH GLADLY AND MISTRESS ANNE BOLEYN'S TO BOOT AND HE EMPTIED THE HORN
7148-82991-0005.flac,THEY TELL ME MISTRESS ANNE BOLEYN IS COMING TO WINDSOR WITH THE KING AND THE KNIGHTS COMPANIONS TO MORROW IS IT SO ASKED THE HOST AGAIN FILLING THE HORN AND HANDING IT TO ANOTHER ATTENDANT
7148-82991-0006.flac,HOW TIMES ARE CHANGED SINCE I BRYAN BOWNTANCE FIRST STEPPED INTO MY FATHER'S SHOES AND BECAME HOST OF THE GARTER IT WAS IN FIFTEEN O ONE TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN KING HENRY THE SEVENTH
7148-82991-0007.flac,RULED THE LAND AND WHEN HIS ELDER SON PRINCE ARTHUR WAS ALIVE LIKEWISE IN THAT YEAR THE YOUNG PRINCE ESPOUSED CATHERINE OF ARRAGON OUR PRESENT QUEEN AND SOON AFTERWARDS DIED WHEREUPON THE OLD KING
7148-82991-0008.flac,NOT LIKING FOR HE LOVED HIS TREASURE BETTER THAN HIS OWN FLESH TO PART WITH HER DOWRY GAVE HER TO HIS SECOND SON HENRY OUR GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN WHOM GOD PRESERVE

7148-82991-0011.flac,TURNED HIS RAGE UPON THE HOST AND SEIZED HIM BY THE THROAT WITH A GRIP THAT THREATENED HIM WITH STRANGULATION INDEED BUT FOR THE INTERVENTION OF THE EARL'S ATTENDANTS WHO RUSHED TO HIS ASSISTANCE
7148-82991-0012.flac,BRYAN CRIED IN A VOICE OF MINGLED RAGE AND SURPRISE TO HIS ASSAILANT
7148-82991-0013.flac,ARE YOU GONE MAD OR DO YOU MISTAKE ME FOR A SHEEP OR A BULLOCK THAT YOU ATTACK ME IN THIS FASHION MY STRONG ALE MUST HAVE GOT INTO YOUR ADDLE PATE WITH A VENGEANCE THE KNAVE HAS BEEN SPEAKING TREASON OF THE KING'S HIGHNESS SAID THE TALL MAN

7148-82991-0023.flac,FULL LENGTH UPON THE GROUND HIS COMPANIONS DREW THEIR SWORDS AND WOULD HAVE INSTANTLY FALLEN UPON THE STURDY OFFENDER IF MORGAN FENWOLF WHO WITH THE EARL OF SURREY WAS STANDING AMONG THE SPECTATORS HAD NOT RUSHED FORWARD AND CLOSING
7148-82991-0024.flac,WITH MARK BEFORE THE LATTER COULD STRIKE A BLOW GRAPPLED WITH HIM AND HELD HIM FAST TILL HE WAS SECURED AND HIS ARMS TIED BEHIND HIM AND SO IT IS YOU MORGAN FENWOLF

7148-82991-0028.flac,HAD ISSUED FROM THE HOSTEL AND JOINED THE EARL AND THEY WALKED TOGETHER AFTER THE CROWD IN A FEW MINUTES THE DUKE OF SHOREDITCH REACHED HENRY THE EIGHTH'S GATE WHERE HE SHOUTED TO A SENTINEL AND TOLD HIM WHAT HAD OCCURRED
7148-82991-0029.flac,AFTER SOME DELAY A WICKET IN THE GATE WAS OPENED AND THE CHIEF PERSONS OF THE PARTY WERE ALLOWED TO PASS THROUGH IT WITH THE PRISONER WHO WAS ASSIGNED TO THE CUSTODY OF A COUPLE OF ARQUEBUSIERS BY THIS TIME AN OFFICER HAD ARRIVED AND IT WAS AGREED
7148-82991-0030.flac,AT THE SUGGESTION OF THE DUKE OF SHOREDITCH TO TAKE THE OFFENDER TO THE CURFEW TOWER ACCORDINGLY THEY CROSSED THE LOWER WARD AND PASSING BENEATH AN ARCHWAY NEAR THE SEMICIRCULAR RANGE OF HABITATIONS ALLOTTED TO THE PETTY CANONS
7148-82991-0031.flac,TRAVERSED THE SPACE BEFORE THE WEST END OF SAINT GEORGE'S CHAPEL AND DESCENDING A SHORT FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS AT THE LEFT AND THREADING A NARROW PASSAGE PRESENTLY ARRIVED AT THE ARCHED ENTRANCE IN THE CURFEW
7148-82991-0032.flac,WHOSE HOARY WALLS SHONE BRIGHTLY IN THE MOONLIGHT THEY HAD TO KNOCK FOR SOME TIME AGAINST THE STOUT OAK DOOR BEFORE ANY NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THE SUMMONS AT LENGTH
7148-82991-0033.flac,THE ROOF OF WHICH WAS COMPOSED OF STOUT PLANKS CROSSED BY HEAVY OAKEN RAFTERS AND SUPPORTED BY BEAMS OF THE SAME MATERIAL ON THE LEFT A STEEP LADDER LIKE FLIGHT OF WOODEN STEPS LED TO AN UPPER ROOM
7148-82991-0034.flac,CAME TO A LOW STRONG DOOR WHICH THEY UNLOCKED AND OBTAINED ADMISSION TO A LARGE OCTANGULAR CHAMBER WITH A VAULTED ROOF AND DEEP EMBRASURES TERMINATED BY NARROW LOOPHOLES
7148-82991-0035.flac,WITH THIS THE PARTY WITHDREW AND THE DOOR WAS FASTENED UPON THE PRISONER AN ARQUEBUSIER WAS STATIONED AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS
7148-82991-0036.flac,HAVING FULLY SATISFIED THEIR CURIOSITY SHAPED THEIR COURSE TOWARDS THE CASTLE GATE ON THEIR WAY THITHER THE EARL LOOKED ABOUT FOR MORGAN FENWOLF BUT COULD NOWHERE DISCERN HIM
7511-102420-0000.flac,CAMP CLOUDCREST OCTOBER SIXTH NINETEEN FOURTEEN DEAR MISSUS CONEY IT SEEMS SO ODD TO BE WRITING YOU AND GETTING NO ANSWERS
7511-102420-0001.flac,I HAVEN'T ONE THING I TOLD HER I OWED YOU MORE LOVE THAN I COULD EVER PAY IN A LIFETIME AND SHE SAID WRITING SUCH LONG LETTERS IS A MIGHTY POOR WAY TO SHOW IT I HAVE BEEN NEGLECTING YOU SHAMEFULLY I THINK
7511-102420-0002.flac,ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I CAME ON THIS HUNT WAS TO TAKE THE TRIP FOR YOU AND TO TELL YOU THINGS THAT YOU WOULD MOST ENJOY SO I WILL SPEND THIS SNOWY DAY IN WRITING TO YOU ON THE NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THERE WAS THE MOST AWFUL THUNDERSTORM I EVER WITNESSED
7511-102420-0003.flac,FLASH AFTER FLASH OF THE MOST BLINDING LIGHTNING FOLLOWED BY DEAFENING PEALS OF THUNDER AND AS IT ECHOED FROM MOUNTAIN TO MOUNTAIN THE UPROAR WAS TERRIFYING I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED A STORM THE BEAT OF HAIL AND RAIN AND THE ROAR OF WIND
7511-102420-0004.flac,ALWAYS APPEAL TO ME BUT THERE WAS NEITHER WIND NOR RAIN JUST FLASH AND ROAR BEFORE THE ECHO DIED AWAY AMONG THE HILLS ANOTHER BOOMING REPORT WOULD SEEM TO SHIVER THE ATMOSPHERE AND SET ALL OUR TINWARE JANGLING
7511-102420-0005.flac,WE ARE CAMPED SO NEAR THE GREAT PINES THAT I WILL CONFESS I WAS POWERFULLY AFRAID HAD THE LIGHTNING STRUCK ONE OF THE BIG PINES THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ONE OF US LEFT I COULD HEAR MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY MURMURING HER PRAYERS WHEN THERE WAS A LULL
7511-102420-0006.flac,WE HAD GONE TO BED BUT I COULDN'T REMAIN THERE SO I SAT ON THE WAGON SEAT WITH JERRINE BESIDE ME SOMETHING STRUCK THE GUY ROPES OF THE TENT AND I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WAS TOO WEAK TO CRY OUT I THOUGHT THE BIG TREE MUST HAVE FALLEN
7511-102420-0007.flac,IN THE LULLS OF THE STORM I COULD HEAR THE MEN'S VOICES HIGH AND EXCITED THEY TOO WERE UP IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE STORM LASTED FOR HOURS BUT AT LAST IT MOVED OFF UP THE VALLEY THE FLASHES GREW TO BE A MERE GLIMMER
7511-102420-0008.flac,AND THE THUNDER MERE RUMBLING THE PINES BEGAN TO MOAN AND SOON A LITTLE BREEZE WHISTLED BY SO WE LAY DOWN AGAIN NEXT MORNING THE HORSES COULD NOT BE FOUND THE STORM HAD FRIGHTENED THEM AND THEY HAD TRIED TO GO HOME
7511-102420-0009.flac,THE MEN HAD TO FIND THEM AND AS IT TOOK MOST OF THE DAY WE HAD TO PUT OFF OUR HUNT WE WERE UP AND ABOUT NEXT MORNING IN THE FIRST FAINT GRAY LIGHT WHILE THE MEN FED GRAIN TO THE HORSES AND SADDLED THEM WE PREPARED A HASTY BREAKFAST
7511-102420-0010.flac,WE WERE OFF BEFORE IT WAS MORE THAN LIGHT ENOUGH FOR US TO SEE THE TRAIL DAWN IN THE MOUNTAINS HOW I WISH I COULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU IF I COULD ONLY MAKE YOU FEEL THE KEEN BRACING AIR THE EXHILARATING CLIMB
7511-102420-0011.flac,GREENISH AMBER LIGHT AND A BLUE GRAY SKY FAR AHEAD OF US WE COULD SEE THE RED RIM ROCK OF A MOUNTAIN ABOVE TIMBER LINE THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN TURNED THE JAGGED PEAKS INTO GOLDEN POINTS OF A CROWN IN OKLAHOMA
7511-102420-0012.flac,EVEN AT THIS SEASON BUT HERE THERE ARE NO SONG BIRDS AND ONLY THE SNAPPING OF TWIGS AS OUR HORSES CLIMBED THE FROSTY TRAIL BROKE THE SILENCE WE HAD BEEN CAUTIONED NOT TO TALK BUT NEITHER MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY NOR I WANTED TO
7511-102420-0013.flac,THE SUN WAS WELL UP WHEN WE REACHED THE LITTLE PARK WHERE WE PICKETED OUR HORSES THEN CAME A LONG HARD CLIMB IT IS HARD CLIMBING AT THE BEST AND WHEN THERE IS A BIG GUN TO CARRY IT IS VERY HARD
7511-102420-0014.flac,THEN TOO WE HAD TO KEEP UP WITH THE MEN AND WE DIDN'T FIND THAT EASY TO DO AT LAST WE REACHED THE TOP AND SAT DOWN ON SOME BOULDERS TO REST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE WE STARTED DOWN TO THE HUNTING GROUND WHICH LAY IN A CUPLIKE VALLEY FAR BELOW US
7511-102420-0015.flac,WE COULD HEAR THE ROAR OF THE GROS VENTRE AS IT TUMBLED GRUMBLINGLY OVER ITS ROCKY BED TO OUR RIGHT ROSE MILE AFTER MILE OF RED CLIFFS AS THE LAST OF THE QUAKING ASP LEAVES HAVE FALLEN THERE WERE NO GOLDEN GROVES
7511-102420-0016.flac,IN THEIR PLACES STOOD SILVERY PATCHES AGAINST THE RED BACKGROUND OF THE CLIFFS HIGH OVERHEAD A TRIANGLE OF WILD GEESE HARROWED THE BLUE SKY I WAS PLUMB OUT OF BREATH BUT MEN WHO ARE MOST GALLANT ELSEWHERE ARE
7511-102420-0017.flac,ABSOLUTELY HEARTLESS ON A HUNT I WAS SCARCELY THROUGH PANTING BEFORE WE BEGAN TO DESCEND WE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS AS TO HOW WE SHOULD MOVE SO AS TO KEEP OUT OF RANGE OF EACH OTHER'S GUNS THEN MISTER HAYNES AND MYSELF STARTED ONE WAY
7511-102420-0018.flac,AND MISTER STRUBLE AND MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY THE OTHER WE WERE TO MEET WHERE THE VALLEY TERMINATED IN A BROAD PASS WE FELT SURE WE COULD GET A CHANCE AT WHAT ELK THERE MIGHT BE IN THE VALLEY WE WERE FOLLOWING FRESH TRACKS AND A LITTLE OF THE HUNTER'S ENTHUSIASM SEIZED ME
7511-102420-0019.flac,WE HAD NOT FOLLOWED THEM FAR WHEN THREE COWS AND A SPIKE CAME RUNNING OUT OF THE PINES A LITTLE AHEAD OF US INSTANTLY MISTER HAYNES'S GUN FLEW TO HIS SHOULDER AND A DEAFENING REPORT JARRED OUR EARS HE RAN FORWARD
7511-102420-0020.flac,BUT I STOOD STILL FASCINATED BY WHAT I SAW OUR SIDE OF THE VALLEY WAS BOUNDED BY A RIM OF ROCK OVER THE RIM WAS A SHEER WALL OF ROCK FOR TWO HUNDRED FEET TO WHERE THE GROS VENTRE WAS ANGRILY ROARING BELOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREAM
7511-102420-0021.flac,ROSE THE RED CLIFFS WITH THEIR JAGGED CRAGS AT THE REPORT OF THE GUN TWO HUGE BLOCKS OF STONE ALMOST AS LARGE AS A HOUSE DETACHED THEMSELVES AND FELL AT THE SAME INSTANT ONE OF THE QUAKING ASP GROVES
7511-102420-0022.flac,BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES I SHUT THEM A MOMENT BUT WHEN I LOOKED THE GROVE WAS MOVING FASTER IT SLID SWIFTLY AND I COULD PLAINLY HEAR THE RATTLE OF STONES FALLING AGAINST STONES UNTIL WITH A MUFFLED ROAR
7511-102420-0023.flac,THE WHOLE HILLSIDE FELL INTO THE STREAM MISTER HAYNES CAME RUNNING BACK WHAT IS THE MATTER ARE YOU HURT WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOOT HE ASKED I WAVED MY HAND WEAKLY TOWARD WHERE THE GREAT MOUND OF TANGLED TREES AND EARTH BLOCKED THE WATER
7511-102420-0024.flac,NOT AN EARTHQUAKE YOU ARE AS WHITE AS A GHOST COME ON UP HERE AND SEE MY FINE ELK I SAT ON A LOG WATCHING HIM DRESS HIS ELK WE HAVE FOUND IT BEST NOT TO REMOVE THE SKIN
7511-102420-0025.flac,BUT THE ELK HAVE TO BE QUARTERED SO AS TO LOAD THEM ON TO A HORSE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY AND MISTER STRUBLE CAME OUT OF THE WOODS JUST THEN THEY HAD SEEN A BIG BUNCH OF ELK HEADED BY A SPLENDID BULL BUT GOT NO SHOT AND THE ELK WENT OUT OF THE PASS
7511-102420-0026.flac,THEY HAD HEARD OUR SHOT AND CAME ACROSS TO SEE WHAT LUCK WHAT IVER IS THE MATTER WITH YE ASKED MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY MISTER HAYNES TOLD HER THEY HAD HEARD THE NOISE BUT HAD THOUGHT IT THUNDER MISTER HAYNES TOLD ME THAT IF I WOULD CHIRK UP
7511-102420-0027.flac,HE WOULD GIVE ME HIS ELK TEETH THOUGH I DON'T ADMIRE THEM THEY ARE CONSIDERED VALUABLE HOWEVER HIS ELK WAS A COW AND THEY DON'T HAVE AS NICE TEETH AS DO BULLS WE HAD LUNCH AND THE MEN COVERED THE ELK WITH PINE BOUGHS
7511-102420-0028.flac,TO KEEP THE CAMP ROBBERS FROM PECKING IT FULL OF HOLES NEXT DAY THE MEN WOULD COME WITH THE HORSES AND PACK IT IN TO CAMP WE ALL FELT REFRESHED SO WE STARTED ON THE TRAIL OF THOSE THAT GOT AWAY
7511-102420-0029.flac,FOR A WHILE WALKING WAS EASY AND WE MADE PRETTY GOOD TIME THEN WE HAD A ROCKY HILL TO GET OVER WE HAD TO USE CARE WHEN WE GOT INTO THE TIMBER THERE WERE MARSHY PLACES WHICH TRIED US SORELY
7511-102420-0030.flac,AND WINDFALL SO THICK THAT WE COULD HARDLY GET THROUGH WE WERE OBLIGED TO PICK OUR WAY CAREFULLY TO AVOID NOISE AND WE WERE ALL TOGETHER NOT HAVING COME TO A PLACE WHERE IT SEEMED BETTER TO SEPARATE
7511-102420-0031.flac,WE HAD ABOUT RESOLVED TO GO TO OUR HORSES WHEN WE HEARD A VOLLEY OF SHOTS THAT IS SOMEBODY BUNCH SHOOTING SAID MISTER STRUBLE THEY ARE IN BREWSTER LAKE PARK BY THE SOUND THAT MEANS THAT THE ELK WILL PASS HERE IN A SHORT TIME AND WE MAY GET A SHOT
7511-102420-0032.flac,THE ELK WILL BE HERE LONG BEFORE THE MEN SINCE THE MEN HAVE NO HORSES SO LET'S HURRY AND GET PLACED ALONG THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN GET OUT WE'LL GET OUR LIMIT WE HASTILY SECRETED OURSELVES ALONG THE NARROW GORGE THROUGH WHICH THE ELK MUST PASS
7511-102420-0033.flac,WE WERE ALL ON ONE SIDE AND MISTER HAYNES SAID TO ME REST YOUR GUN ON THAT ROCK AND AIM AT THE FIRST RIB BACK OF THE SHOULDER IF YOU SHOOT HAPHAZARD YOU MAY CRIPPLE AN ELK AND LET IT GET AWAY TO DIE IN MISERY SO MAKE SURE WHEN YOU FIRE
7511-102420-0034.flac,IT DIDN'T SEEM A MINUTE BEFORE WE HEARD THE BEAT OF THEIR HOOFS AND A QUEER PANTING NOISE THAT I CAN'T DESCRIBE FIRST CAME A BEAUTIFUL THING WITH HIS HEAD HELD HIGH
7511-102420-0035.flac,HIS EYES WERE STARTLED AND HIS SHINING BLACK MANE SEEMED TO BRISTLE I HEARD THE REPORT OF GUNS AND HE TUMBLED IN A CONFUSED HEAP HE TRIED TO RISE BUT OTHERS COMING LEAPED OVER HIM AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN SOME MORE SHOTS
7511-102420-0036.flac,AND THOSE BEHIND TURNED AND WENT BACK THE WAY THEY HAD COME MISTER HAYNES SHOUTED TO ME SHOOT SHOOT WHY DON'T YOU SHOOT SO I FIRED MY KRAG BUT NEXT I FOUND MYSELF PICKING MYSELF UP
7511-102420-0037.flac,AND WONDERING WHO HAD STRUCK ME AND FOR WHAT I WAS SO DIZZY I COULD SCARCELY MOVE BUT I GOT DOWN TO WHERE THE OTHERS WERE EXCITEDLY ADMIRING THE TWO DEAD ELK THAT THEY SAID WERE THE VICTIMS OF MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY'S GUN
7511-102420-0038.flac,SHE WAS AS EXCITED AND DELIGHTED AS IF SHE HAD NEVER DECLARED SHE WOULD NOT KILL ANYTHING SURE IT'S MANY A MEAL THEY'LL MAKE FOR LITTLE HUNGRY MOUTHS SHE SAID SHE WAS RUBBING HER SHOULDER RUEFULLY
7511-102420-0039.flac,I THOUGHT OLD GOLIAR HAD HIT ME A BIFF WITH A BLACKTHORN SHILALEY SHE REMARKED MISTER HAYNES TURNED TO ME AND SAID YOU ARE A DANDY HUNTER YOU DIDN'T SHOOT AT ALL UNTIL AFTER THE ELK WERE GONE
7511-102420-0040.flac,AND THE WAY YOU HELD YOUR GUN IT IS A WONDER IT DIDN'T KNOCK YOUR HEAD OFF INSTEAD OF JUST SMASHING YOUR JAW THE MEN WORKED AS FAST AS THEY COULD AT THE ELK AND WE HELPED AS MUCH AS WE COULD BUT IT WAS DARK BEFORE WE REACHED CAMP
7511-102420-0041.flac,SUPPER WAS READY BUT I WENT TO BED AT ONCE THEY ALL THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED BUT IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO STIFF AND SORE I COULD HARDLY MOVE AND SO TIRED I COULDN'T SLEEP NEXT MORNING MY JAW AND NECK WERE SO SWOLLEN
7511-102420-0042.flac,THAT I HATED ANY ONE TO SEE ME AND MY HEAD ACHED FOR TWO DAYS IT HAS BEEN SNOWING FOR A LONG TIME BUT CLYDE SAYS HE WILL TAKE ME HUNTING WHEN IT STOPS
7511-102420-0043.flac,AND GO BACK EMPTY HANDED AND PARTLY TO GET A REST FROM MISTER MURRY'S EVERLASTING ACCORDION MISTER MURRY IS AN OLD TIME ACQUAINTANCE OF MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY'S HE HAS A RANCH DOWN ON THE RIVER SOMEWHERE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY HAS NOT SEEN HIM FOR YEARS
7511-102420-0044.flac,DIDN'T KNOW HE LIVED UP HERE HE HAD SEEN THE GAME WARDEN FROM WHOM SHE HAD PROCURED HER LICENSE AND SO HUNTED UP OUR CAMP HE IS AN ODD LOOKING INDIVIDUAL WITH SAD EYES AND A DROOPING MOUTH WHICH GIVES HIS FACE A MOST HOPELESS REPROACHFUL EXPRESSION
7511-102420-0045.flac,HIS NOSE HOWEVER SEEMS TO UPSET THE ORIGINAL PLAN FOR IT IS LONG AND THIN AND BENT SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE HIS NECK IS LONG AND HIS ADAM'S APPLE SEEMS UNCERTAIN AS TO WHERE IT BELONGS AT SUPPER JERRINE WATCHED IT
7511-102420-0046.flac,AS IF FASCINATED UNTIL I SENT HER FROM THE TABLE AND WENT OUT TO SPEAK TO HER ABOUT GAZING WHY MAMMA SHE SAID I HAD TO LOOK HE HAS SWALLOWED SOMETHING THAT WON'T GO EITHER UP OR DOWN AND I'M FRAID HE'LL CHOKE
7511-102420-0047.flac,ALTHOUGH I CAN'T BRAG ABOUT MISTER MURRY'S APPEARANCE I CAN ABOUT HIS TASTE FOR HE ADMIRES MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY IT SEEMS THAT IN YEARS GONE BY HE HAS MADE ATTEMPTS TO MARRY HER AS HE GOT UP FROM SUPPER THE FIRST NIGHT HE WAS WITH US HE SAID

7511-102419-0002.flac,TO BEGIN WITH THE MORNING WE LEFT THE HOLTS ELIZABETH SUGGESTED THAT WE THREE WOMEN RIDE IN THE BUCKBOARD SO I SEATED MYSELF ON A ROLL OF BEDDING IN THE BACK PART
7511-102419-0003.flac,THE SKY WAS CLEAR BLUE
7511-102419-0004.flac,THE MOUNTAINS ON ONE SIDE WERE CRESTED GREAT CRAGS AND PILES OF ROCK CROWNED THEM AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE TIMBER GREW ONLY ABOUT HALFWAY UP THE TRUNKS OF THE QUAKING ASPENS SHONE SILVERY IN THE EARLY SUNLIGHT AND THEIR LEAVES WERE SHIMMERING GOLD
7511-102419-0005.flac,AND THE STATELY PINES KEPT WHISPERING AND MURMURING IT ALMOST SEEMED AS IF THEY WERE CHIDING THE QUAKING ASPENS FOR BEING FRIVOLOUS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD LAY THE RIVER BORDERED BY WILLOWS AND GRASSY FLATS
7511-102419-0006.flac,THERE WERE MANY SMALL LAKES AND THE DUCKS AND GEESE WERE NOISILY ENJOYING THEMSELVES AMONG THE RUSHES AND WATER GRASSES BEYOND THE RIVER ROSE THE FOREST COVERED MOUNTAINS HILL UPON HILL ELIZABETH DRESSED WITH ESPECIAL CARE THAT MORNING
7511-102419-0007.flac,AND VERY PRETTY SHE LOOKED IN HER NEAT SHEPHERD'S PLAID SUIT AND NATTY LITTLE WHITE CANVAS HAT VERY SOON SHE SAID I HOPE NEITHER OF YOU WILL MISUNDERSTAND ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT IF MY HOPES ARE REALIZED I WILL NOT RIDE WITH YOU MUCH LONGER
7511-102419-0008.flac,I NEVER SAW SUCH A COUNTRY AS THE WEST
7511-102419-0009.flac,AND I NEVER SAW SUCH PEOPLE YOU ARE JUST LIKE YOUR COUNTRY YOU HAVE FED ME CARED FOR ME AND BEFRIENDED ME A STRANGER

7511-102419-0011.flac,WILL BE THE GREATEST HELP TO ME IN BECOMING WHAT I HOPE TO BECOME A REAL WESTERNER I MIGHT HAVE LIVED A LONG TIME IN THE WEST AND NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD MANY THINGS IF I HAD NOT FALLEN INTO YOUR HANDS YEARS AGO
7511-102419-0012.flac,BEFORE I WAS THROUGH SCHOOL I WAS TO HAVE BEEN MARRIED BUT I LOST MY MOTHER JUST THEN AND WAS LEFT THE CARE OF MY PARALYTIC FATHER IF I HAD MARRIED THEN I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO TAKE FATHER FROM HIS FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS BECAUSE WALLACE CAME WEST IN THE FORESTRY SERVICE
7511-102419-0013.flac,I FELT THAT IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT POOR FATHER COULDN'T SPEAK BUT HIS EYES TOLD ME HOW GRATEFUL HE WAS TO STAY WE HAD OUR LITTLE HOME AND FATHER HAD HIS PENSION AND I WAS ABLE TO GET A SMALL SCHOOL NEAR US
7511-102419-0014.flac,I COULD TAKE CARE OF FATHER AND TEACH ALSO WE WERE VERY COMFORTABLY SITUATED AND IN TIME BECAME REALLY HAPPY ALTHOUGH I SELDOM HEARD FROM WALLACE HIS LETTERS WERE WELL WORTH WAITING FOR AND I KNEW HE WAS DOING WELL
7511-102419-0015.flac,EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO FATHER DIED GENTLY WENT TO SLEEP I WAITED SIX MONTHS AND THEN WROTE TO WALLACE BUT RECEIVED NO REPLY
7511-102419-0016.flac,I COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER AND HAVE COME TO SEE WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIM IF HE IS DEAD MAY I STAY ON WITH ONE OF YOU AND PERHAPS GET A SCHOOL I WANT TO LIVE HERE ALWAYS BUT DARLINT SAID MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY
7511-102419-0017.flac,SUPPOSIN IT'S MARRIED YOUR MAN IS WALLACE MAY HAVE CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT ME BUT HE WOULD NOT MARRY WITHOUT TELLING ME IF HE IS ALIVE HE IS HONORABLE THEN I ASKED
7511-102419-0018.flac,IF HE IS STATIONED IN THE BRIDGES RESERVE THEY WOULD BE SURE TO KNOW OF HIM AT ANY OF THESE LITTLE PLACES I JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO I SHOULD NEVER HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT I HAVE ONLY I THINK I OWE IT TO YOU AND IT WAS EASIER BECAUSE OF THE HOLTS
7511-102419-0019.flac,I AM SO GLAD WE MET THEM SO WE DROVE ALONG TALKING TOGETHER WE EACH ASSURED THE GIRL OF OUR ENTIRE WILLINGNESS TO HAVE HER AS A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY AFTER A WHILE I GOT ON TO THE WAGON WITH MISTER STEWART AND TOLD HIM ELIZABETH'S STORY
7511-102419-0020.flac,AND WE HELD OUR BREATH UNTIL WE EMERGED ON THE OTHER SIDE MISTER SORENSON IS A VERY CAPABLE AND CONSCIENTIOUS GAME WARDEN AND A VERY GENIAL GENTLEMAN HE RODE DOWN TO MEET US
7511-102419-0021.flac,TO INSPECT OUR LICENSE AND TO TELL US ABOUT OUR PRIVILEGES AND OUR DUTIES AS GOOD WOODSMEN HE ALSO ISSUES LICENSES IN CASE HUNTERS HAVE NEGLECTED TO SECURE THEM BEFORE COMING MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY HAD REFUSED TO GET A LICENSE WHEN WE DID
7511-102419-0022.flac,SHE SAID SHE WAS NOT GOING TO HUNT SHE TOLD US WE COULD GIVE HER A SMALL PIECE OF ILK AND THAT WOULD DO SO WE WERE RATHER SURPRISED WHEN SHE PURCHASED TWO LICENSES ONE A SPECIAL WHICH WOULD ENTITLE HER TO A BULL ELK
7511-102419-0023.flac,AS WE WERE STARTING MISTER STEWART ASKED THE GAME WARDEN CAN YOU TELL ME IF WALLACE WHITE IS STILL STATIONED HERE OH YES MISTER SORENSON SAID WALLACE'S PLACE IS ONLY A FEW MILES UP THE RIVER AND CAN BE PLAINLY SEEN FROM THE ROAD WE DROVE ON
7511-102419-0024.flac,HAPPINESS HAD TAKEN A NEW CLUTCH UPON MY HEART I LOOKED BACK EXPECTING TO SEE ELIZABETH ALL SMILES BUT IF YOU WILL BELIEVE ME THE FOOLISH GIRL WAS SOBBING AS IF HER HEART WAS BROKEN MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY DREW HER HEAD DOWN UPON HER SHOULDER
7511-102419-0025.flac,AND WAS TRYING TO QUIET HER THE ROAD ALONG THERE WAS VERY ROUGH STAYING ON THE WAGON OCCUPIED ALL MY ATTENTION FOR A WHILE SEVERAL MILES WERE PASSED WHEN WE CAME IN SIGHT OF A BEAUTIFUL CABIN HALF HIDDEN IN A GROVE OF PINES BEYOND THE RIVER
7511-102419-0026.flac,MISTER STEWART SAID WE MIGHT AS WELL NOON AS SOON AS WE CAME TO A GOOD PLACE AND THEN HE WOULD RIDE ACROSS AND SEE MISTER WHITE JUST AS WE ROUNDED THE HILL A HORSEMAN CAME TOWARD US A SPLENDID FELLOW HE WAS
7511-102419-0027.flac,MANLY STRENGTH AND GRACE SHOWING IN EVERY LINE THE ROAD WAS NARROW AGAINST THE HILLSIDE AND HE HAD TO RIDE QUITE CLOSE SO I SAW HIS HANDSOME FACE PLAINLY AS SOON AS HE SAW ELIZABETH HE SPRANG FROM HIS SADDLE AND SAID LIZ'BETH LIZ'BETH
7511-102419-0028.flac,SHE HELD HER HANDS TO HIM AND SAID OH JUST RIDING WITH FRIENDS THEN TO MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY SHE SAID THIS IS MY WALLACE MISTER STEWART IS THE QUEEREST MAN
7511-102419-0029.flac,INSTEAD OF LETTING ME ENJOY THE TABLEAU HE SOLEMNLY DROVE ON SAYING HE WOULD NOT WANT ANY ONE GAWKING AT HIM IF HE WERE THE HAPPY MAN ANYWAY HE COULDN'T URGE CHUB FAST ENOUGH TO PREVENT MY SEEING AND HEARING WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU
7511-102419-0030.flac,BESIDES THAT I SAW THAT ELIZABETH'S HAT WAS ON AWRY HER HAIR IN DISORDER AND HER EYES RED IT WAS DISAPPOINTING AFTER SHE HAD BEEN SO CAREFUL TO LOOK NICELY MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY CAME TROTTING ALONG AND WE STOPPED FOR DINNER
7511-102419-0031.flac,WE HAD JUST GOT THE COFFEE BOILING WHEN THE LOVERS CAME UP ELIZABETH IN THE SADDLE LEARNING TO RIDE AND HE WALKING BESIDE HER HOLDING HER HAND HOW HAPPY THEY WERE THE REST OF US WERE MIGHTY NEAR AS FOOLISH AS THEY
7511-102419-0032.flac,THEY WERE GOING TO START IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER ON HORSEBACK FOR THE COUNTY SEAT TO BE MARRIED AFTER WE HAD EATEN ELIZABETH SELECTED A FEW THINGS FROM HER TRUNK AND MISTER STEWART AND MISTER WHITE DROVE THE BUCKBOARD ACROSS THE RIVER TO LEAVE THE TRUNK IN ITS NEW HOME
7511-102419-0033.flac,WHILE THEY WERE GONE WE HELPED ELIZABETH TO DRESS ALL THE WHILE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY WAS ADMONISHING HER TO NAME HER FIRST GIRUL MARY ELLEN OR SHE SAID
7511-102419-0034.flac,WHICH WAS ME NAME BEFORE I WAS MARRIED TO ME MAN GOD REST HIS SOUL DEAR ELIZABETH SHE WAS GLAD TO GET AWAY I SUSPECT SHE AND HER WALLACE MADE A FINE COUPLE AS THEY RODE AWAY IN THE GOLDEN SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON
7511-102419-0035.flac,I BELIEVE SHE IS ONE HAPPY BRIDE THAT THE SUN SHONE ON IF THE OMEN HAS FAILED EVERYWHERE ELSE WELL WE FELT POWERFULLY REDUCED IN NUMBERS BUT ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK THAT AFTERNOON WE CAME UPON MISTER STRUBLE AND MISTER HAYNES
7511-102419-0036.flac,WAITING BESIDE THE ROAD FOR US THEY HAD COME TO PILOT US INTO CAMP FOR THERE WOULD BE NO ROAD SOON SUCH A WAY AS WE CAME OVER SUCH JOLTING AND SLIDING I BEGGED TO GET OFF AND WALK
7511-102419-0037.flac,BUT AS THE WHOLE WAY WAS CARPETED BY STRAWBERRY VINES AND THERE WERE LATE BERRIES TO TEMPT ME TO LOITER I HAD TO STAY ON THE WAGON I HAD NO IDEA A WAGON COULD BE GOT ACROSS SUCH PLACES MISTER STRUBLE DROVE FOR MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY
7511-102419-0038.flac,AND I COULD HEAR HER IMPLORING ALL THE SAINTS TO PRESERVE US FROM INSTANT DEATH I KEPT SHUTTING MY EYES TRYING NOT TO SEE THE TERRIFYING PLACES AND OPENING THEM AGAIN TO SEE THE BEAUTY SPREAD EVERYWHERE UNTIL MISTER STEWART SAID
7511-102419-0039.flac,IT MUST MAKE YOU NERVOUS TO RIDE OVER MOUNTAIN ROADS DON'T BAT YOUR EYES SO FAST AND YOU'LL SEE MORE SO THEN I STIFFENED MY BACK AND KEPT MY EYES OPEN AND I DID SEE MORE IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO GO AS FAR AS WE COULD WITH THE WAGONS AND THEN SET CAMP
7511-102419-0040.flac,FROM THERE THE HUNTERS WOULD RIDE HORSEBACK AS FAR UP AS THEY COULD AND THEN CLIMB IT WAS ALMOST SUNDOWN WHEN WE REACHED CAMP ALL THE HUNTERS WERE IN AND SUCH A YOWLING AS THEY SET UP
7511-102419-0041.flac,LOOK WHO'S HERE SEE WHO'S COME THEY YELLED THEY WENT TO WORK SETTING UP TENTS AND UNLOADING WAGONS WITH A HEARTY GOOD WILL WE ARE CAMPED JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE PINES BACK OF US RISES A BIG PINE CLAD MOUNTAIN
7511-102419-0042.flac,OUR TENTS ARE SET UNDER SOME BIG TREES ON A SMALL PLATEAU AND RIGHT BELOW US IS A VALLEY IN WHICH GRASS GROWS KNEE HIGH AND LITTLE STREAMS COME FROM EVERY WAY TROUT SCURRY UP STREAM WHENEVER WE GO NEAR
7511-102419-0043.flac,WE CALL THE VALLEY PARADISE VALLEY BECAUSE IT IS THE HORSES PARADISE AND AS IN THE EARLY MORNING WE CAN OFTEN SEE CLOUDS ROLLING ALONG THE VALLEY WE CALL OUR CAMP CLOUDCREST WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL PLACE IT IS WELL SHELTERED
7511-102419-0044.flac,THERE IS PLENTY OF WOOD WATER AND FEED AND LOOKING EASTWARD DOWN THE VALLEY SNOW COVERED CRAG TOPPED MOUNTAINS DELIGHT THE EYE THE AIR IS SO BRACING THAT WE ALL FEEL EQUAL TO ANYTHING
7511-102419-0045.flac,MISTER STRUBLE HAS ALREADY KILLED A FINE SPIKE ELK FOR CAMP EATING WE CAMPED IN A BUNCH AND WE HAVE CAMP STOVES SO THAT IN CASE OF RAIN OR SNOW WE CAN STAY INDOORS JUST NOW WE HAVE A HUGE CAMP FIRE
7511-102419-0046.flac,AROUND WHICH WE SIT IN THE EVENING TELLING STORIES SINGING AND EATING NUTS OF THE PINON PINE THEN TOO THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS FILLED WITH THOSE TINY LITTLE STRAWBERRIES WE HAVE TO GATHER ALL DAY TO GET AS MUCH AS WE CAN EAT
7511-102419-0047.flac,BUT THEY ARE DELICIOUS YESTERDAY WE HAD PIE MADE OF WILD CURRANTS THERE ARE A POWERFUL LOT OF THEM HERE THERE IS ALSO A LITTLE BLUEBERRY THAT THE MEN SAY IS THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN HUCKLEBERRY THE GROUSE ARE FEEDING ON THEM
7511-102419-0048.flac,ALTOGETHER THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PLACES IMAGINABLE THE MEN ARE NOT VERY ANXIOUS TO BEGIN HUNTING A LITTLE DELAY MEANS COOLER WEATHER FOR THE MEAT IT IS COOL UP HERE BUT GOING BACK ACROSS THE DESERT IT WILL BE WARM FOR A WHILE YET STILL
7511-102419-0049.flac,WHEN THEY SEE ELK EVERY DAY IT IS A GREAT TEMPTATION TO TRY A SHOT ONE OF THE STUDENTS TOLD ME PROFESSOR GLENHOLDT WAS HERE TO GET THE TIP END BONE OF THE TAIL OF A BRONTOSAURUS
7511-102419-0050.flac,AS HE HAD HEARD THEY WERE FINE EATING HAVING STRATA OF FAT ALTERNATING WITH STRATA OF LEAN MISTER HAYNES IS A QUIET FELLOW JUST INTERESTED IN HUNTING MISTER STRUBLE IS THE BIG MAN OF THE PARTY
7511-102419-0051.flac,HE IS TALL AND STRONG AND WE FIND HIM VERY PLEASANT COMPANY THEN THERE IS DOCTOR TESCHALL HE IS A QUIET FELLOW WITH AN UNEXPECTED SMILE HE IS SO RESERVED THAT I FELT THAT HE WAS KIND OF OUT OF PLACE AMONG THE REST UNTIL I CAUGHT HIS CORDIAL SMILE
7511-102419-0052.flac,NOT TO MENTION CARRYING THE HEAVY GUN THEY ARE USING THE LARGEST CALIBER SPORTING GUNS MURDEROUS LOOKING THINGS THAT IS ALL EXCEPT MISTER HARKRUDDER THE PICTURE MAN
7511-102419-0053.flac,HE LOOKS TO BE ABOUT FORTY YEARS OLD BUT WHOOPS AND LAUGHS LIKE HE WAS ABOUT TEN I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU OF THE GOOD MON DO I HE IS JUST THE KIND QUIET GOOD MON THAT HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SINCE I HAVE KNOWN HIM
7511-102419-0054.flac,HE TOLD MISTER HAYNES HE WAS TOO TAM SEEK IN DE BEL SO WE HAD TO COME WITHOUT HIM
7511-102419-0055.flac,AND ARE ALL WILLING TO HELP I DON'T THINK I SHALL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU OF ANY GREAT EXPLOITS I MAKE WITH THE GUN I FIRED ONE THAT MISTER STEWART CARRIES AND IT ALMOST KICKED MY SHOULDER OFF I AM MYSTIFIED ABOUT MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY'S LICENSE
7511-102419-0056.flac,I KNOW SHE WOULD NOT SHOOT ONE OF THOSE BIG GUNS FOR A DOZEN ELK BESIDES THAT SHE IS VERY TENDER HEARTED AND WILL NEVER HARM ANYTHING HERSELF ALTHOUGH SHE LIKES TO JOIN OUR HUNTS I THINK YOU MUST BE TIRED OF THIS LETTER SO I AM GOING TO SAY GOOD NIGHT MY FRIEND
5463-39173-0000.flac,CHAPTER TWENTY ONE WHY PUCK THE PONY WAS BEATEN MARK ROBARTS RETURNED HOME THE DAY AFTER THE SCENE AT THE ALBANY CONSIDERABLY RELIEVED IN SPIRIT
5463-39173-0001.flac,INDEED AFTER WHAT MISTER SOWERBY HAD SAID AND AFTER LORD LUFTON'S ASSENT TO IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS HE CONSIDERED TO DECLINE IT AND THEN TOO MISTER SOWERBY'S PROMISE ABOUT THE BILLS WAS VERY COMFORTABLE TO HIM AFTER ALL
5463-39173-0002.flac,ON THE DAY AFTER HIS RETURN HE RECEIVED PROPER AUTHENTIC TIDINGS OF HIS PRESENTATION TO THE PREBEND HE WAS IN FACT ALREADY PREBENDARY
5463-39173-0003.flac,THE INCOME WAS ALREADY HIS OWN
5463-39173-0004.flac,THE ENJOYMENT OF ONE'S OWN HAPPINESS AT SUCH WINDFALLS DEPENDS SO MUCH ON THE FREE AND FREELY EXPRESSED ENJOYMENT OF OTHERS LADY LUFTON'S CONGRATULATIONS HAD NEARLY MADE HIM THROW UP THE WHOLE THING BUT HIS WIFE'S SMILES RE ENCOURAGED HIM
5463-39173-0005.flac,AND LUCY'S WARM AND EAGER JOY MADE HIM FEEL QUITE DELIGHTED WITH MISTER SOWERBY AND THE DUKE OF OMNIUM AND THEN THAT SPLENDID ANIMAL DANDY CAME HOME TO THE PARSONAGE STABLES MUCH TO THE DELIGHT OF THE GROOM AND GARDENER
5463-39173-0006.flac,WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT FROM MISTER SOWERBY SOME LITTLE TIME SINCE WITH THE OBJECT OF OBLIGING HIM HE MARK INTENDED TO SELL HIM AGAIN AS SOON AS HE COULD DO SO JUDICIOUSLY THIS AS I HAVE SAID ABOVE WAS NOT SATISFACTORY
5463-39173-0007.flac,NEITHER OF THE TWO LADIES AT FRAMLEY PARSONAGE KNEW MUCH ABOUT HORSES OR OF THE MANNER IN WHICH ONE GENTLEMAN MIGHT THINK IT PROPER TO OBLIGE ANOTHER BY PURCHASING THE SUPERFLUITIES OF HIS STABLE BUT THEY DID BOTH FEEL THAT THERE WERE HORSES ENOUGH IN THE PARSONAGE STABLE WITHOUT DANDY
5463-39173-0008.flac,AND THAT THE PURCHASING OF A HUNTER WITH THE VIEW OF IMMEDIATELY SELLING HIM AGAIN WAS TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT AN OPERATION HARDLY CONGENIAL WITH THE USUAL TASTES AND PURSUITS OF A CLERGYMAN I HOPE YOU DID NOT GIVE VERY MUCH MONEY FOR HIM MARK SAID FANNY
5463-39173-0009.flac,NOT MORE THAN I SHALL GET AGAIN SAID MARK
5463-39173-0010.flac,I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO GO INTO RESIDENCE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SAID MARK RECURRING TO THE MORE AGREEABLE SUBJECT OF THE STALL
5463-39173-0011.flac,THE HOUSE WILL NOT BE FURNISHED WILL IT MARK SAID HIS WIFE I DON'T KNOW HOW WE SHALL GET ON DON'T FRIGHTEN YOURSELVES I SHALL TAKE LODGINGS IN BARCHESTER AND WE SHALL NOT SEE YOU ALL THE TIME SAID MISSUS ROBARTS WITH DISMAY
5463-39173-0012.flac,BUT THE PREBENDARY EXPLAINED THAT HE WOULD BE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AT FRAMLEY EVERY WEEK AND THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY HE WOULD ONLY SLEEP AT BARCHESTER ON THE SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS AND PERHAPS NOT ALWAYS THEN
5463-39173-0013.flac,THE WORST OF IT IS THAT BOTH OF THEM ARE OBLIGED TO WEAR WIGS SHALL YOU HAVE A HAT MARK WITH CURLY THINGS AT THE SIDE AND STRINGS THROUGH TO HOLD THEM UP ASKED LUCY I FEAR THAT DOES NOT COME WITHIN MY PERQUISITES NOR A ROSETTE
5463-39173-0014.flac,IT WAS NOW THE MONTH OF APRIL AND THE FIELDS WERE BEGINNING TO LOOK GREEN AND THE WIND HAD GOT ITSELF OUT OF THE EAST AND WAS SOFT AND GENIAL AND THE EARLY SPRING FLOWERS WERE SHOWING THEIR BRIGHT COLOURS IN THE PARSONAGE GARDEN AND ALL THINGS WERE SWEET AND PLEASANT
5463-39173-0015.flac,WENT AWAY WHEN THE SPRING CAME LEAVING THEIR HOUSES INNOCENT AND EMPTY THE PARISH DUTY WAS BETTER ATTENDED TO AND PERHAPS DOMESTIC DUTIES ALSO AT SUCH PERIOD HE WAS A PATTERN PARSON AND A PATTERN HUSBAND
5463-39173-0016.flac,ATONING TO HIS OWN CONSCIENCE FOR PAST SHORTCOMINGS BY PRESENT ZEAL AND THEN THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED IT TO HERSELF THE ABSENCE OF HER DEAR FRIEND LADY LUFTON WAS PERHAPS IN ITSELF NOT DISAGREEABLE MISSUS ROBARTS DID LOVE LADY LUFTON HEARTILY
5463-39173-0017.flac,INDEED JUST AT THIS MOMENT
5463-39173-0018.flac,DANDY WAS RATHER A THORN IN HIS SIDE THOSE WRETCHED BILLS WERE TO COME DUE EARLY IN MAY AND BEFORE THE END OF APRIL SOWERBY WROTE TO HIM SAYING THAT HE WAS DOING HIS UTMOST TO PROVIDE FOR THE EVIL DAY
5463-39173-0019.flac,BUT THAT IF THE PRICE OF DANDY COULD BE REMITTED TO HIM AT ONCE IT WOULD GREATLY FACILITATE HIS OBJECT NOTHING COULD BE MORE DIFFERENT THAN MISTER SOWERBY'S TONE ABOUT MONEY AT DIFFERENT TIMES WHEN HE WANTED TO RAISE THE WIND EVERYTHING WAS SO IMPORTANT
5463-39173-0020.flac,HASTE AND SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS AND MEN RUNNING TO AND FRO WITH BLANK ACCEPTANCES IN THEIR HANDS COULD ALONE STAVE OFF THE CRACK OF DOOM BUT AT OTHER TIMES WHEN RETALIATORY APPLICATIONS WERE MADE TO HIM
5463-39173-0021.flac,HE COULD PROVE WITH THE EASIEST VOICE AND MOST JAUNTY MANNER THAT EVERYTHING WAS QUITE SERENE NOW AT THIS PERIOD HE WAS IN THAT MOOD OF SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS AND HE CALLED LOUDLY FOR THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS FOR DANDY AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED
5463-39173-0022.flac,MARK COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO SAY THAT HE WOULD PAY NOTHING TILL THE BILLS WERE SAFE AND THEREFORE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF MISTER FORREST OF THE BANK HE DID REMIT THE PRICE OF DANDY TO HIS FRIEND SOWERBY IN LONDON AND LUCY ROBARTS
5463-39173-0023.flac,SHE HAD DECLARED TO HIM PLAINLY THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM AND COULD NOT LOVE HIM AND HAD THUS THROWN AWAY NOT ONLY RICHES AND HONOUR AND HIGH STATION BUT MORE THAN THAT MUCH WORSE THAN THAT SHE HAD FLUNG AWAY FROM HER THE LOVER TO WHOSE LOVE HER WARM HEART CLUNG
5463-39173-0024.flac,THAT HER LOVE DID CLING TO HIM SHE KNEW EVEN THEN AND OWNED MORE THOROUGHLY AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE SO MUCH HER PRIDE HAD DONE FOR HER AND THAT STRONG RESOLVE THAT LADY LUFTON SHOULD NOT SCOWL ON HER AND TELL HER THAT SHE HAD ENTRAPPED HER SON
5463-39173-0025.flac,I KNOW IT WILL BE SAID OF LORD LUFTON HIMSELF THAT PUTTING ASIDE HIS PEERAGE AND BROAD ACRES AND HANDSOME SONSY FACE HE WAS NOT WORTH A GIRL'S CARE AND LOVE
5463-39173-0026.flac,BUT WHAT WOULD THE WORLD COME TO IF NONE BUT ABSOLUTE TRUE HEROES WERE TO BE THOUGHT WORTHY OF WOMEN'S LOVE WHAT WOULD THE MEN DO AND WHAT OH WHAT WOULD BECOME OF THE WOMEN
5463-39173-0027.flac,LUCY ROBARTS IN HER HEART DID NOT GIVE HER DISMISSED LOVER CREDIT FOR MUCH MORE HEROISM THAN DID TRULY APPERTAIN TO HIM DID NOT PERHAPS GIVE HIM FULL CREDIT FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HEROISM WHICH DID REALLY APPERTAIN TO HIM
5463-39173-0028.flac,TREATS HERSELF AS A FARMER TREATS HIS SHEEP AND OXEN MAKES HARDLY MORE OF HERSELF OF HER OWN INNER SELF IN WHICH ARE COMPRISED A MIND AND SOUL THAN THE POOR WRETCH OF HER OWN SEX WHO EARNS HER BREAD IN THE LOWEST STAGE OF DEGRADATION
5463-39173-0029.flac,BUT A TITLE AND AN ESTATE AND AN INCOME ARE MATTERS WHICH WILL WEIGH IN THE BALANCE WITH ALL EVE'S DAUGHTERS AS THEY DO WITH ALL ADAM'S SONS PRIDE OF PLACE AND THE POWER OF LIVING WELL IN FRONT OF THE WORLD'S EYE ARE DEAR TO US ALL ARE DOUBTLESS INTENDED TO BE DEAR
5463-39173-0030.flac,THE MISTRESS OF SUCH A DESTINY WHAT MORE OR WHAT BETTER COULD THE WORLD HAVE DONE FOR HER AND NOW SHE HAD THROWN ALL THAT ASIDE BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT ENDURE THAT LADY LUFTON SHOULD CALL HER A SCHEMING ARTFUL GIRL ACTUATED BY THAT FEAR SHE HAD REPULSED HIM WITH A FALSEHOOD
5463-39173-0031.flac,THOUGH THE MATTER WAS ONE ON WHICH IT WAS SO TERRIBLY EXPEDIENT THAT SHE SHOULD TELL THE TRUTH AND YET SHE WAS CHEERFUL WITH HER BROTHER AND SISTER IN LAW
5463-39173-0032.flac,IT WAS WHEN SHE WAS QUITE ALONE AT NIGHT IN HER OWN ROOM OR IN HER SOLITARY WALKS THAT A SINGLE SILENT TEAR WOULD GATHER IN THE CORNER OF HER EYE AND GRADUALLY MOISTEN HER EYELIDS SHE NEVER TOLD HER LOVE NOR DID SHE ALLOW CONCEALMENT TO FEED ON HER DAMASK CHEEK
5463-39173-0033.flac,IN ALL HER EMPLOYMENTS IN HER WAYS ABOUT THE HOUSE AND HER ACCUSTOMED QUIET MIRTH SHE WAS THE SAME AS EVER IN THIS SHE SHOWED THE PECULIAR STRENGTH WHICH GOD HAD GIVEN HER BUT NOT THE LESS DID SHE IN TRUTH MOURN FOR HER LOST LOVE AND SPOILED AMBITION
5463-39173-0034.flac,WE ARE GOING TO DRIVE OVER TO HOGGLESTOCK THIS MORNING FANNY SAID ONE DAY AT BREAKFAST I SUPPOSE MARK YOU WON'T GO WITH US
5463-39173-0035.flac,THE PONY CARRIAGE IS WRETCHED FOR THREE OH AS FOR THAT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE NEW HORSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CARRY YOU AS FAR AS THAT I HEARD YOU SAY YOU WANTED TO SEE MISTER CRAWLEY SO I DO AND THE NEW HORSE AS YOU CALL HIM SHALL CARRY ME THERE TO MORROW
5463-39173-0036.flac,WILL YOU SAY THAT I'LL BE OVER ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK YOU HAD BETTER SAY EARLIER AS HE IS ALWAYS OUT ABOUT THE PARISH VERY WELL SAY ELEVEN IT IS PARISH BUSINESS ABOUT WHICH I AM GOING SO IT NEED NOT IRK HIS CONSCIENCE TO STAY IN FOR ME
5463-39173-0037.flac,WELL LUCY WE MUST DRIVE OURSELVES THAT'S ALL YOU SHALL BE CHARIOTEER GOING AND THEN WE'LL CHANGE COMING BACK TO ALL WHICH LUCY AGREED AND AS SOON AS THEIR WORK IN THE SCHOOL WAS OVER THEY STARTED
5463-39173-0038.flac,NOT A WORD HAD BEEN SPOKEN BETWEEN THEM ABOUT LORD LUFTON SINCE THAT EVENING NOW MORE THAN A MONTH AGO ON WHICH THEY HAD BEEN WALKING TOGETHER IN THE GARDEN LUCY HAD SO DEMEANED HERSELF ON THAT OCCASION
5463-39173-0039.flac,AS TO MAKE HER SISTER IN LAW QUITE SURE THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO LOVE PASSAGES UP TO THAT TIME AND NOTHING HAD SINCE OCCURRED WHICH HAD CREATED ANY SUSPICION IN MISSUS ROBARTS MIND SHE HAD SEEN AT ONCE THAT ALL THE CLOSE INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM WAS OVER AND THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING WAS AS IT SHOULD BE
5463-39173-0040.flac,BUT SHE DID NOT BETRAY HERSELF PERHAPS HE MAY SHE SAID AND THEN GAVE THE PONY A LITTLE TOUCH WITH HER WHIP OH LUCY I WON'T HAVE PUCK BEATEN HE WAS GOING VERY NICELY I BEG PUCK'S PARDON
5463-39173-0041.flac,BUT YOU SEE WHEN ONE IS TRUSTED WITH A WHIP ONE FEELS SUCH A LONGING TO USE IT OH BUT YOU SHOULD KEEP IT STILL I FEEL ALMOST CERTAIN THAT LADY LUFTON WOULD LIKE SUCH A MATCH I DARESAY SHE MIGHT MISS GRANTLY WILL HAVE A LARGE FORTUNE I BELIEVE
5463-39173-0042.flac,AND THEN SHE IS QUIET AND RESERVED SHE DOES NOT REQUIRE EXCITEMENT AND I AM SURE IS CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HER DUTIES VERY CONSCIENTIOUS I HAVE NO DOUBT SAID LUCY WITH SOMETHING LIKE A SNEER IN HER TONE BUT THE QUESTION I SUPPOSE IS
5463-39173-0043.flac,WHETHER LORD LUFTON LIKES HER I THINK HE DOES IN A SORT OF WAY HE DID NOT TALK TO HER SO MUCH AS HE DID TO YOU AH THAT WAS ALL LADY LUFTON'S FAULT BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE HIM PROPERLY LABELLED
5463-39173-0044.flac,OH BY GOD'S MERCY VERY LITTLE AS FOR ME I SHALL GET OVER IT IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS I DON'T DOUBT THAT'S IF I CAN GET ASS'S MILK AND CHANGE OF AIR WE'LL TAKE YOU TO BARCHESTER FOR THAT BUT AS I WAS SAYING I REALLY DO THINK LORD LUFTON LIKES GRISELDA GRANTLY
5463-39173-0045.flac,THEN I REALLY DO THINK THAT HE HAS UNCOMMON BAD TASTE SAID LUCY WITH A REALITY IN HER VOICE DIFFERING MUCH FROM THE TONE OF BANTER SHE HAD HITHERTO USED WHAT LUCY SAID HER SISTER IN LAW LOOKING AT HER
5463-39173-0046.flac,THERE IS I BELIEVE NOTHING IN HER MENTALLY WHATEVER MAY BE HER MORAL EXCELLENCES TO ME SHE IS MORE ABSOLUTELY LIKE A STATUE THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING I EVER SAW TO SIT STILL AND BE ADMIRED IS ALL THAT SHE DESIRES AND IF SHE CANNOT GET THAT
5463-39173-0047.flac,TO SIT STILL AND NOT BE ADMIRED WOULD ALMOST SUFFICE FOR HER I DO NOT WORSHIP LADY LUFTON AS YOU DO BUT I THINK QUITE WELL ENOUGH OF HER TO WONDER THAT SHE SHOULD CHOOSE SUCH A GIRL AS THAT FOR HER SON'S WIFE THAT SHE DOES WISH IT I DO NOT DOUBT
5463-39173-0048.flac,BUT I SHALL INDEED BE SURPRISED IF HE WISHES IT ALSO AND THEN AS SHE FINISHED HER SPEECH LUCY AGAIN FLOGGED THE PONY THIS SHE DID IN VEXATION BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT THE TELL TALE BLOOD HAD SUFFUSED HER FACE WHY LUCY
5463-39173-0049.flac,IF HE WERE YOUR BROTHER YOU COULD NOT BE MORE EAGER ABOUT IT NO I COULD NOT HE IS THE ONLY MAN FRIEND WITH WHOM I WAS EVER INTIMATE AND I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK THAT HE SHOULD THROW HIMSELF AWAY IT'S HORRIDLY IMPROPER TO CARE ABOUT SUCH A THING I HAVE NO DOUBT
5463-39173-0050.flac,I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED IT'S NO USE YOUR LOOKING AT ME FANNY YOU WILL MAKE ME TALK OF IT AND I WON'T TELL A LIE ON THE SUBJECT I DO LIKE LORD LUFTON VERY MUCH AND I DO DISLIKE GRISELDA GRANTLY ALMOST AS MUCH
5463-39173-0051.flac,THEREFORE I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED IF THEY BECOME MAN AND WIFE HOWEVER
5463-39173-0052.flac,THERE WAS THEN NOTHING MORE SAID ON THE SUBJECT AND IN TWO MINUTES THEY ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF THE HOGGLESTOCK CLERGYMAN MISSUS CRAWLEY HAD BROUGHT TWO CHILDREN WITH HER WHEN SHE CAME FROM THE CORNISH CURACY TO HOGGLESTOCK AND TWO OTHER BABIES HAD BEEN ADDED TO HER CARES SINCE THEN
5463-39173-0053.flac,ONE OF THESE WAS NOW ILL WITH CROUP AND IT WAS WITH THE OBJECT OF OFFERING TO THE MOTHER SOME COMFORT AND SOLACE THAT THE PRESENT VISIT WAS MADE THE TWO LADIES GOT DOWN FROM THEIR CARRIAGE HAVING OBTAINED THE SERVICES OF A BOY TO HOLD PUCK AND SOON FOUND THEMSELVES IN MISSUS CRAWLEY'S SINGLE SITTING ROOM
5463-39173-0054.flac,WHICH THEY KNEW IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE IN MISTER CRAWLEY'S PRESENCE SHE AS WE HAVE SAID WAS NOT QUITE SO GAUNT NOT ALTOGETHER SO HAGGARD AS IN THE LATTER OF THOSE DREADFUL CORNISH DAYS LADY LUFTON AND MISSUS ARABIN BETWEEN THEM
5463-39173-0055.flac,AND THE SCANTY COMFORT OF THEIR IMPROVED THOUGH STILL WRETCHED INCOME HAD DONE SOMETHING TOWARDS BRINGING HER BACK TO THE WORLD IN WHICH SHE HAD LIVED IN THE SOFT DAYS OF HER CHILDHOOD BUT EVEN THE LIBERAL STIPEND OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
5463-39173-0056.flac,LIBERAL ACCORDING TO THE SCALE BY WHICH THE INCOMES OF CLERGYMEN IN SOME OF OUR NEW DISTRICTS ARE NOW APPORTIONED WOULD NOT ADMIT OF A GENTLEMAN WITH HIS WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN LIVING WITH THE ORDINARY COMFORTS OF AN ARTISAN'S FAMILY
5463-39173-0057.flac,AS REGARDS THE MERE EATING AND DRINKING THE AMOUNTS OF BUTCHER'S MEAT AND TEA AND BUTTER THEY OF COURSE WERE USED IN QUANTITIES WHICH ANY ARTISAN WOULD HAVE REGARDED AS COMPATIBLE ONLY WITH DEMI STARVATION BETTER CLOTHING FOR HER CHILDREN WAS NECESSARY AND BETTER CLOTHING FOR HIM
5463-39173-0058.flac,AS FOR HER OWN RAIMENT THE WIVES OF FEW ARTISANS WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTENT TO PUT UP WITH MISSUS CRAWLEY'S BEST GOWN THE STUFF OF WHICH IT WAS MADE HAD BEEN PAID FOR BY HER MOTHER WHEN SHE WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY BESTOWED UPON HER DAUGHTER HER MODEST WEDDING TROUSSEAU
5463-39173-0059.flac,LUCY HAD NEVER SEEN MISSUS CRAWLEY THESE VISITS TO HOGGLESTOCK WERE NOT FREQUENT AND HAD GENERALLY BEEN MADE BY LADY LUFTON AND MISSUS ROBARTS TOGETHER
5463-39173-0060.flac,ALMOST AS PENNILESS AS THE CURATE HIMSELF THEN THEY WOULD WALK TOGETHER FOR HOURS ALONG THE ROCK BOUND SHORE LISTENING TO THE WAVES DISCUSSING DEEP POLEMICAL MYSTERIES SOMETIMES WITH HOT FURY THEN AGAIN WITH TENDER LOVING CHARITY
5463-39173-0061.flac,BUT ALWAYS WITH A MUTUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF EACH OTHER'S TRUTH NOW THEY LIVED COMPARATIVELY NEAR TOGETHER BUT NO OPPORTUNITIES AROSE FOR SUCH DISCUSSIONS AT ANY RATE ONCE A QUARTER MISTER CRAWLEY WAS PRESSED BY HIS OLD FRIEND TO VISIT HIM AT THE DEANERY
5463-39173-0062.flac,AND DOCTOR ARABIN HAD PROMISED THAT NO ONE ELSE SHOULD BE IN THE HOUSE IF MISTER CRAWLEY OBJECTED TO SOCIETY BUT THIS WAS NOT WHAT HE WANTED THE FINERY AND GRANDEUR OF THE DEANERY AND THE COMFORT OF THAT WARM SNUG LIBRARY WOULD SILENCE HIM AT ONCE
5463-39173-0063.flac,THEN OLD DAYS WOULD HAVE COME BACK TO THEM BUT NOW ARABIN ALWAYS RIDES ON A SLEEK FINE HORSE NOW A DAYS HE ONCE SAID TO HIS WIFE WITH A SNEER
5463-39174-0000.flac,AT THE END OF THE LAST CHAPTER WE LEFT LUCY ROBARTS WAITING FOR AN INTRODUCTION TO MISSUS CRAWLEY WHO WAS SITTING WITH ONE BABY IN HER LAP WHILE SHE WAS ROCKING ANOTHER WHO LAY IN A CRADLE AT HER FEET MISTER CRAWLEY IN THE MEANWHILE HAD RISEN FROM HIS SEAT WITH HIS FINGER BETWEEN THE LEAVES OF AN OLD GRAMMAR
5463-39174-0001.flac,FOR SHE HAD WORK OF THIS KIND OF HER OWN AT HOME WHICH SHE BY NO MEANS NEGLECTED THOUGH THE ATTENDANCE OF NURSES WAS MORE PLENTIFUL WITH HER THAN AT HOGGLESTOCK MISSUS CRAWLEY DID GET UP AND TOLD LUCY THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER AND MISTER CRAWLEY CAME FORWARD GRAMMAR IN HAND LOOKING HUMBLE AND MEEK
5463-39174-0002.flac,THE REALITIES OF LIFE HAD BECOME SO STERN TO HER THAT THE OUTWARD ASPECTS OF THEM WERE AS NOTHING SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED A NEW GOWN BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING TO HER IF ALL THE COUNTY KNEW THAT THE ONE IN WHICH SHE WENT TO CHURCH HAD BEEN TURNED THREE TIMES
5463-39174-0003.flac,IT GALLED HIM HOWEVER TO THINK THAT HE AND HIS WERE SO POORLY DRESSED I AM AFRAID YOU CAN HARDLY FIND A CHAIR MISS ROBARTS SAID MISTER CRAWLEY
5463-39174-0004.flac,MOVING A PILE OF RAGGED COVERLESS BOOKS ON TO THE TABLE I HOPE HE'LL FORGIVE ME FOR MOVING THEM THEY ARE NOT BOB'S AT LEAST NOT THE MOST OF THEM BUT MINE SAID THE GIRL BUT SOME OF THEM ARE MINE SAID THE BOY AIN'T THEY GRACE
5463-39174-0005.flac,AND ARE YOU A GREAT SCHOLAR ASKED LUCY DRAWING THE CHILD TO HER I DON'T KNOW SAID GRACE WITH A SHEEPISH FACE I AM IN GREEK DELECTUS AND THE IRREGULAR VERBS GREEK DELECTUS AND THE IRREGULAR VERBS AND LUCY PUT UP HER HANDS WITH ASTONISHMENT
5463-39174-0006.flac,AND SHE KNOWS AN ODE OF HORACE ALL BY HEART SAID BOB AN ODE OF HORACE SAID LUCY STILL HOLDING THE YOUNG SHAMEFACED FEMALE PRODIGY CLOSE TO HER KNEES IT IS ALL THAT I CAN GIVE THEM SAID MISTER CRAWLEY APOLOGETICALLY
5463-39174-0007.flac,A LITTLE SCHOLARSHIP IS THE ONLY FORTUNE THAT HAS COME IN MY WAY AND I ENDEAVOUR TO SHARE THAT WITH MY CHILDREN I BELIEVE MEN SAY THAT IT IS THE BEST FORTUNE ANY OF US CAN HAVE SAID LUCY THINKING HOWEVER IN HER OWN MIND
5463-39174-0008.flac,THAT HORACE AND THE IRREGULAR GREEK VERBS SAVOURED TOO MUCH OF PRECOCIOUS FORCING IN A YOUNG LADY OF NINE YEARS OLD BUT NEVERTHELESS GRACE WAS A PRETTY SIMPLE LOOKING GIRL AND CLUNG TO HER ALLY CLOSELY AND SEEMED TO LIKE BEING FONDLED
5463-39174-0009.flac,SO THAT LUCY ANXIOUSLY WISHED THAT MISTER CRAWLEY COULD BE GOT RID OF AND THE PRESENTS PRODUCED I HOPE YOU HAVE LEFT MISTER ROBARTS QUITE WELL SAID MISTER CRAWLEY WITH A STIFF CEREMONIAL VOICE
5463-39174-0010.flac,YES I HAVE HEARD OF IT SAID MISTER CRAWLEY GRAVELY I HOPE THAT HIS PROMOTION MAY TEND IN EVERY WAY TO HIS ADVANTAGE HERE AND HEREAFTER IT SEEMED HOWEVER TO BE MANIFEST FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED HIS KIND WISHES
5463-39174-0011.flac,THAT HIS HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS DID NOT GO HAND IN HAND TOGETHER BY THE BY HE DESIRED US TO SAY THAT HE WILL CALL HERE TO MORROW AT ABOUT ELEVEN DIDN'T HE SAY FANNY YES
5463-39174-0012.flac,LOOKING UP FOR A MOMENT FROM THE ANXIOUS DISCUSSION IN WHICH SHE WAS ALREADY ENGAGED WITH MISSUS CRAWLEY ON NURSERY MATTERS PRAY TELL HIM SAID MISTER CRAWLEY THAT I SHALL BE HAPPY TO SEE HIM
5463-39174-0013.flac,HIS NEW DUTIES DO NOT DISTURB HIM MUCH AS YET SAID LUCY AND HIS RIDING OVER HERE WILL BE NO TROUBLE TO HIM YES THERE HE HAS THE ADVANTAGE OVER ME I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE NO HORSE
5463-39174-0014.flac,AND THEN LUCY BEGAN PETTING THE LITTLE BOY AND BY DEGREES SLIPPED A SMALL BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS OUT OF HER MUFF INTO HIS HANDS SHE HAD NOT THE PATIENCE NECESSARY FOR WAITING AS HAD HER SISTER IN LAW THE BOY TOOK THE BAG PEEPED INTO IT AND THEN LOOKED UP INTO HER FACE
5463-39174-0015.flac,WHAT IS THAT BOB SAID MISTER CRAWLEY GINGERBREAD FALTERED BOBBY FEELING THAT A SIN HAD BEEN COMMITTED THOUGH PROBABLY FEELING ALSO THAT HE HIMSELF COULD HARDLY AS YET BE ACCOUNTED AS DEEPLY GUILTY MISS ROBARTS SAID THE FATHER WE ARE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
5463-39174-0016.flac,BUT OUR CHILDREN ARE HARDLY USED TO SUCH THINGS
5463-39174-0017.flac,OH CERTAINLY BOB MY CHILD
5463-39174-0018.flac,AND THEN THE BAG IN A SOLEMN MANNER WAS CARRIED OVER TO THEIR MOTHER WHO TAKING IT FROM HER SON'S HANDS LAID IT HIGH ON A BOOKSHELF AND NOT ONE NOW SAID LUCY ROBARTS VERY PITEOUSLY DON'T BE SO HARD MISTER CRAWLEY NOT UPON THEM BUT UPON ME
5463-39174-0019.flac,THIS WAS VERY DISCOURAGING TO LUCY IF ONE SMALL BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS CREATED SO GREAT A DIFFICULTY HOW WAS SHE TO DISPOSE OF THE POT OF GUAVA JELLY AND BOX OF BONBONS WHICH WERE STILL IN HER MUFF OR HOW DISTRIBUTE THE PACKET OF ORANGES WITH WHICH THE PONY CARRIAGE WAS LADEN
5463-39174-0020.flac,AND THERE WAS JELLY FOR THE SICK CHILD AND CHICKEN BROTH WHICH WAS INDEED ANOTHER JELLY AND TO TELL THE TRUTH OPENLY THERE WAS ALSO A JOINT OF FRESH PORK AND A BASKET OF EGGS FROM THE FRAMLEY PARSONAGE FARMYARD WHICH MISSUS ROBARTS WAS TO INTRODUCE SHOULD SHE FIND HERSELF CAPABLE OF DOING SO
5463-39174-0021.flac,BUT WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY BE CAST OUT WITH UTTER SCORN BY MISTER CRAWLEY IF TENDERED IN HIS IMMEDIATE PRESENCE THERE HAD ALSO BEEN A SUGGESTION AS TO ADDING TWO OR THREE BOTTLES OF PORT BUT THE COURAGE OF THE LADIES HAD FAILED THEM ON THAT HEAD AND THE WINE WAS NOT NOW ADDED TO THEIR DIFFICULTIES
5463-39174-0022.flac,LUCY FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP A CONVERSATION WITH MISTER CRAWLEY THE MORE SO AS MISSUS ROBARTS AND MISSUS CRAWLEY PRESENTLY WITHDREW INTO A BEDROOM TAKING THE TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN WITH THEM HOW UNLUCKY THOUGHT LUCY THAT SHE HAS NOT GOT MY MUFF WITH HER
5463-39174-0023.flac,BUT THE MUFF LAY IN HER LAP PONDEROUS WITH ITS RICH ENCLOSURES I SUPPOSE YOU WILL LIVE IN BARCHESTER FOR A PORTION OF THE YEAR NOW SAID MISTER CRAWLEY I REALLY DO NOT KNOW AS YET MARK TALKS OF TAKING LODGINGS FOR HIS FIRST MONTH'S RESIDENCE
5463-39174-0024.flac,MARK THINKS THAT AS HE IS SO NEAR HE NEED NOT BE MUCH ABSENT FROM FRAMLEY EVEN DURING HIS RESIDENCE AND THEN LADY LUFTON IS SO GOOD ABOUT THE SCHOOLS AH YES BUT LADY LUFTON IS NOT A CLERGYMAN MISS ROBARTS
5463-39174-0025.flac,IT WAS ON LUCY'S TONGUE TO SAY THAT HER LADYSHIP WAS PRETTY NEARLY AS BAD BUT SHE STOPPED HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT PROVIDENCE SENT GREAT RELIEF TO MISS ROBARTS IN THE SHAPE OF MISSUS CRAWLEY'S RED ARMED MAID OF ALL WORK WHO WALKING UP TO HER MASTER
5463-39174-0026.flac,WHISPERED INTO HIS EAR THAT HE WAS WANTED IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY AT WHICH HIS ATTENDANCE WAS ALWAYS REQUIRED IN HIS PARISH SCHOOL AND THAT ATTENDANCE BEING SO PUNCTUALLY GIVEN THOSE WHO WANTED HIM LOOKED FOR HIM THERE AT THIS HOUR AND IF HE WERE ABSENT DID NOT SCRUPLE TO SEND FOR HIM
5463-39174-0027.flac,MISS ROBARTS I AM AFRAID YOU MUST EXCUSE ME SAID HE GETTING UP AND TAKING HIS HAT AND STICK LUCY BEGGED THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE AT ALL IN THE WAY AND ALREADY BEGAN TO SPECULATE HOW SHE MIGHT BEST UNLOAD HER TREASURES
5463-39174-0028.flac,AND THEN STICK IN HAND HE WALKED FORTH AND LUCY FANCIED THAT BOBBY'S EYES IMMEDIATELY RESTED ON THE BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS BOB SAID SHE ALMOST IN A WHISPER
5463-39174-0029.flac,I HAVE LEFT A BOOK BEHIND ME HE SAID AND COMING BACK THROUGH THE ROOM HE TOOK UP THE WELL WORN PRAYER BOOK WHICH ACCOMPANIED HIM IN ALL HIS WANDERINGS THROUGH THE PARISH BOBBY WHEN HE SAW HIS FATHER HAD RETREATED A FEW STEPS BACK AS ALSO DID GRACE WHO TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
5463-39174-0030.flac,HAD BEEN ATTRACTED BY THE SOUND OF SUGAR PLUMS IN SPITE OF THE IRREGULAR VERBS AND LUCY WITHDREW HER HAND FROM HER MUFF AND LOOKED GUILTY WAS SHE NOT DECEIVING THE GOOD MAN NAY TEACHING HIS OWN CHILDREN TO DECEIVE HIM
5463-39174-0031.flac,BUT THERE ARE MEN MADE OF SUCH STUFF THAT AN ANGEL COULD HARDLY LIVE WITH THEM WITHOUT SOME DECEIT PAPA'S GONE NOW WHISPERED BOBBY I SAW HIM TURN ROUND THE CORNER HE AT ANY RATE HAD LEARNED HIS LESSON AS IT WAS NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD DO
5463-39174-0032.flac,SOME ONE ELSE ALSO HAD LEARNED THAT PAPA WAS GONE FOR WHILE BOB AND GRACE WERE STILL COUNTING THE BIG LUMPS OF SUGAR CANDY EACH EMPLOYED THE WHILE FOR INWARD SOLACE WITH AN INCH OF BARLEY SUGAR THE FRONT DOOR OPENED AND A BIG BASKET AND A BUNDLE DONE UP IN A KITCHEN CLOTH
5463-39174-0033.flac,I DID VENTURE TO BRING THEM SAID FANNY WITH A LOOK OF SHAME FOR I KNOW HOW A SICK CHILD OCCUPIES THE WHOLE HOUSE AH MY FRIEND SAID MISSUS CRAWLEY TAKING HOLD OF MISSUS ROBARTS ARM AND LOOKING INTO HER FACE THAT SORT OF SHAME IS OVER WITH ME
5463-39174-0034.flac,GOD HAS TRIED US WITH WANT AND FOR MY CHILDREN'S SAKE I AM GLAD OF SUCH RELIEF BUT WILL HE BE ANGRY I WILL MANAGE IT DEAR MISSUS ROBARTS YOU MUST NOT BE SURPRISED AT HIM HIS LOT IS SOMETIMES VERY HARD TO BEAR
5463-39174-0035.flac,SUCH THINGS ARE SO MUCH WORSE FOR A MAN THAN FOR A WOMAN FANNY WAS NOT QUITE PREPARED TO ADMIT THIS IN HER OWN HEART BUT SHE MADE NO REPLY ON THAT HEAD I AM SURE I HOPE WE MAY BE ABLE TO BE OF USE TO YOU SHE SAID IF YOU WILL ONLY LOOK UPON ME AS AN OLD FRIEND AND WRITE TO ME IF YOU WANT ME
5463-39174-0036.flac,TO FEEL HERSELF SO DIFFERENT FROM THE WIVES OF OTHER CLERGYMEN AROUND HER TO KNOW THAT THEY LIVED SOFTLY WHILE SHE WITH ALL THE WORK OF HER HANDS AND UNCEASING STRUGGLE OF HER ENERGIES COULD HARDLY MANAGE TO PLACE WHOLESOME FOOD BEFORE HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING A GRIEVOUS THING TO THINK OF
5463-39174-0037.flac,THAT ALL THE WORK OF HER MIND SHOULD BE GIVEN UP TO SUCH SUBJECTS AS THESE BUT NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD BEAR IT SHE SAID AS LONG AS HE WOULD CARRY HIMSELF LIKE A MAN AND FACE HIS LOT BOLDLY BEFORE THE WORLD AND THEN SHE TOLD HOW HE HAD BEEN BETTER THERE AT HOGGLESTOCK THAN IN THEIR FORMER RESIDENCE DOWN IN CORNWALL
5463-39174-0038.flac,MISSUS ARABIN TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS SO ANXIOUS YOU SHOULD GO TO THEM SAID MISSUS ROBARTS AH YES BUT THAT I FEAR IS IMPOSSIBLE THE CHILDREN YOU KNOW MISSUS ROBARTS
5463-39174-0039.flac,OH NO I COULD NOT PUNISH YOU FOR YOUR GOODNESS IN THAT WAY BUT HE WOULD NOT GO HE COULD GO AND LEAVE ME AT HOME SOMETIMES I HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE SO AND I HAVE DONE ALL IN MY POWER TO PERSUADE HIM I HAVE TOLD HIM THAT IF HE COULD MIX ONCE MORE WITH THE WORLD WITH THE CLERICAL WORLD YOU KNOW
5463-39174-0040.flac,THAT HE WOULD BE BETTER FITTED FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS OWN DUTIES BUT HE ANSWERS ME ANGRILY THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HIS COAT IS NOT FIT FOR THE DEAN'S TABLE AND MISSUS CRAWLEY ALMOST BLUSHED AS SHE SPOKE OF SUCH A REASON WHAT WITH AN OLD FRIEND LIKE DOCTOR ARABIN
5463-39174-0041.flac,BUT WHAT CAN I DO I FEAR THAT HE REGARDS THE RICH AS HIS ENEMIES HE IS PINING FOR THE SOLACE OF SOME FRIEND TO WHOM HE COULD TALK FOR SOME EQUAL WITH A MIND EDUCATED LIKE HIS OWN TO WHOSE THOUGHTS HE COULD LISTEN AND TO WHOM HE COULD SPEAK HIS OWN THOUGHTS
5463-39174-0042.flac,BUT SUCH A FRIEND MUST BE EQUAL NOT ONLY IN MIND BUT IN PURSE AND WHERE CAN HE EVER FIND SUCH A MAN AS THAT BUT YOU MAY GET BETTER PREFERMENT AH NO AND IF HE DID WE ARE HARDLY FIT FOR IT NOW IF I COULD THINK THAT I COULD EDUCATE MY CHILDREN
5463-39174-0043.flac,IF I COULD ONLY DO SOMETHING FOR MY POOR GRACE IN ANSWER TO THIS MISSUS ROBARTS SAID A WORD OR TWO BUT NOT MUCH SHE RESOLVED HOWEVER THAT IF SHE COULD GET HER HUSBAND'S LEAVE SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE FOR GRACE
5463-39174-0044.flac,AND WAS IT NOT INCUMBENT ON HER TO MAKE SOME KINDLY USE OF ALL THE GOODS WITH WHICH PROVIDENCE HAD BLESSED HERSELF AND THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THE SITTING ROOM EACH AGAIN WITH A YOUNG CHILD IN HER ARMS
5463-39174-0045.flac,LUCY HAD BEEN ENGAGED THE WHILE WITH THE CHILDREN AND WHEN THE TWO MARRIED LADIES ENTERED THEY FOUND THAT A SHOP HAD BEEN OPENED AT WHICH ALL MANNER OF LUXURIES WERE BEING READILY SOLD AND PURCHASED AT MARVELLOUSLY EASY PRICES THE GUAVA JELLY WAS THERE AND THE ORANGES AND THE SUGAR PLUMS RED AND YELLOW AND STRIPED
5463-39174-0046.flac,AND MOREOVER THE GINGERBREAD HAD BEEN TAKEN DOWN IN THE AUDACITY OF THEIR COMMERCIAL SPECULATIONS AND THE NUTS WERE SPREAD OUT UPON A BOARD BEHIND WHICH LUCY STOOD AS SHOP GIRL DISPOSING OF THEM FOR KISSES MAMMA MAMMA SAID BOBBY RUNNING UP TO HIS MOTHER YOU MUST BUY SOMETHING OF HER
5463-39174-0047.flac,AND HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGERS AT THE SHOP GIRL YOU MUST GIVE HER TWO KISSES FOR THAT HEAP OF BARLEY SUGAR LOOKING AT BOBBY'S MOUTH AT THE TIME ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HIS KISSES MIGHT BE DISPENSED WITH WHEN THEY WERE AGAIN IN THE PONY CARRIAGE BEHIND THE IMPATIENT PUCK AND WERE WELL AWAY FROM THE DOOR
5463-39174-0048.flac,FANNY WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK HOW VERY DIFFERENT THOSE TWO ARE SHE SAID DIFFERENT IN THEIR MINDS AND IN THEIR SPIRIT BUT HOW MUCH HIGHER TONED IS HER MIND THAN HIS HOW WEAK HE IS IN MANY THINGS AND HOW STRONG SHE IS IN EVERYTHING
5463-39174-0049.flac,HOW FALSE IS HIS PRIDE AND HOW FALSE HIS SHAME BUT WE MUST REMEMBER WHAT HE HAS TO BEAR IT IS NOT EVERY ONE THAT CAN ENDURE SUCH A LIFE AS HIS WITHOUT FALSE PRIDE AND FALSE SHAME BUT SHE HAS NEITHER SAID LUCY
5463-39174-0050.flac,BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE HERO IN A FAMILY DOES THAT GIVE YOU A RIGHT TO EXPECT ANOTHER SAID MISSUS ROBARTS OF ALL MY OWN ACQUAINTANCE MISSUS CRAWLEY I THINK COMES NEAREST TO HEROISM AND THEN THEY PASSED BY THE HOGGLESTOCK SCHOOL AND MISTER CRAWLEY WHEN HE HEARD THE NOISE OF THE WHEELS CAME OUT

1447-17506-0001.flac,AT DINNER IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE FAMOUS TARANTELLA WOULD BE DANCED IN THE LOWER HALL OF THE HOTEL AT NINE O'CLOCK AND THE GIRLS TOLD UNCLE JOHN THAT THEY MUST NOT MISS THIS FAMOUS SIGHT WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE IN SORRENTO OR INDEED IN ALL ITALY
1447-17506-0002.flac,AS THEY ENTERED THE PRETTY CIRCULAR HALL DEVOTED TO THE DANCE LOUISE GAVE A START OF SURPRISE
1447-17506-0003.flac,A GOODLY AUDIENCE HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED IN THE ROOM AND AMONG THEM THE GIRL SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE AN ACQUAINTANCE FOR AFTER A BRIEF HESITATION SHE ADVANCED AND PLACED HER HAND IN THAT OF A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD RISEN ON HER ENTRANCE AND HASTENED TOWARD HER
1447-17506-0004.flac,HE WAS A NICE LOOKING YOUNG FELLOW BETH THOUGHT AND HAD A FOREIGN AND QUITE DISTINGUISHED AIR PRESENTLY LOUISE TURNED WITH CHEEKS SOMEWHAT FLUSHED AND BROUGHT THE GENTLEMAN TO HER PARTY
1447-17506-0005.flac,INTRODUCING HIM TO UNCLE JOHN AND HER COUSINS AS COUNT FERRALTI WHOM SHE HAD ONCE MET IN NEW YORK WHILE HE WAS ON A VISIT TO AMERICA
1447-17506-0006.flac,THE COUNT TWIRLED HIS SMALL AND SLENDER MOUSTACHES IN A WAY THAT PATSY THOUGHT AFFECTED AND SAID IN EXCELLENT ENGLISH
1447-17506-0007.flac,NEW YORK ADOPTS A GOOD MANY SAID UNCLE JOHN DRILY IT HAS EVEN BEEN THOUGHTLESS ENOUGH TO ADOPT ME THE DANCERS ENTERED AT THAT MOMENT AND THE AMERICANS WERE FORCED TO SEAT THEMSELVES HASTILY SO AS NOT TO OBSTRUCT THE VIEW OF OTHERS
1447-17506-0008.flac,COUNT FERRALTI FOUND A PLACE BESIDE LOUISE BUT SEEMED TO HAVE LITTLE TO SAY TO HER DURING THE COURSE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT THE DANCES WERE UNIQUE AND GRACEFUL BEING EXECUTED BY A TROUP OF LAUGHING PEASANTS DRESSED IN NATIVE COSTUME
1447-17506-0009.flac,WHO SEEMED VERY PROUD OF THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENT AND ANXIOUS TO PLEASE THE THRONG OF TOURISTS PRESENT THE TARANTELLA ORIGINATED IN ISCHIA BUT SORRENTO AND CAPRI HAVE THE BEST DANCERS
1447-17506-0010.flac,AFTERWARD UNCLE JOHN AND HIS NIECES STOOD UPON THE TERRACE AND WATCHED THE VOLCANO ROLLING ITS DENSE CLOUDS MINGLED WITH SPARKS OF RED HOT SCORIA TOWARD THE SKY
1447-17506-0011.flac,THE COUNT CLUNG TO LOUISE'S SIDE BUT ALSO TRIED TO MAKE HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO HER COUSINS
1447-17506-0012.flac,AND BETH REPLIED THAT HIS MANNERS WERE SO LIKE THOSE OF THEIR COUSIN LOUISE THAT THE TWO OUGHT TO GET ALONG NICELY TOGETHER UNCLE JOHN LIKED HIS NIECES TO MAKE FRIENDS AND ENCOURAGED YOUNG MEN GENERALLY TO MEET THEM
1447-17506-0013.flac,BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE APPEARANCE OF THIS CALLOW ITALIAN NOBLEMAN THAT STAMPED HIS CHARACTER AS ARTIFICIAL AND INSINCERE HE RESOLVED TO FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT HIS ANTECEDENTS BEFORE HE PERMITTED THE YOUNG FELLOW
1447-17506-0014.flac,TO ESTABLISH FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH HIS GIRLS NEXT MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST HE WANDERED THROUGH THE LOBBY AND PAUSED AT THE LITTLE OFFICE WHERE HE DISCOVERED THAT THE PROPRIETOR OF THIS HOTEL WAS A BROTHER OF THAT FLORIANO WHO MANAGED THE HOTEL DU VESUVE
1447-17506-0015.flac,THAT GAVE HIM AN EXCUSE TO TALK WITH THE MAN WHO SPOKE VERY GOOD ENGLISH AND WAS EXCEEDINGLY COURTEOUS TO HIS GUESTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY WERE AMERICAN
1447-17506-0016.flac,COUNT FERRALTI THE YOUNG MAN STANDING BY THE WINDOW YONDER I I DID NOT KNOW HE SAID HESITATINGLY THE GENTLEMAN ARRIVED LAST EVENING AND I HAD NOT YET LEARNED HIS NAME LET ME SEE
1447-17506-0017.flac,HE TURNED TO HIS LIST OF GUESTS WHO REGISTER BY CARD AND NOT IN A BOOK AND CONTINUED
1447-17506-0018.flac,HE HAS GIVEN HIS NAME AS FERRALTI BUT ADDED NO TITLE A COUNT DID YOU SAY YES REPLIED UNCLE JOHN THE PROPRIETOR LOOKED CURIOUSLY TOWARD THE YOUNG MAN WHOSE BACK ONLY WAS VISIBLE
1447-17506-0019.flac,THEN HE REMARKED THAT THE ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS WAS WANING AND THE TROUBLE NEARLY OVER FOR THIS TIME
1447-17506-0020.flac,THAT I CANNOT TELL YOU SIGNOR MERRICK OH PERHAPS YOU KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE NOBILITY OF YOUR COUNTRY I I KNOW LITTLE OF THE NOBILITY ANSWERED FLORIANO INDIGNANTLY

1447-17506-0023.flac,HE TURNED THE PAGES AND RAN HIS FINGER DOWN THE LINE OF FS FIND ME IF YOU CAN A COUNT FERRALTI IN THE LIST UNCLE JOHN LOOKED HE PUT ON HIS GLASSES AND LOOKED AGAIN
1447-17506-0024.flac,AND NO SUCH NOBLE FAMILY SIGNOR MERRICK UNCLE JOHN WHISTLED SOFTLY AND WALKED AWAY TO THE WINDOW THE YOUNG MAN GREETED HIM WITH A SMILE AND A BOW I MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR NAME LAST EVENING HE SAID I THOUGHT YOU WERE COUNT FERRALTI
